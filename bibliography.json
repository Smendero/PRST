		"abstract": "The lipid composition of microbial communities can indicate their response to changes in the surrounding environment induced by anthropogenic practices, chemical contamination or climatic conditions. A considerable number of analytical techniques exist for the examination of microbial lipids. This article reviews a selection of methods available for environmental samples as applied for lipid extraction, fractionation, derivatization and quantiﬁcation. The discussion focuses on the origin of the standard methods, the different modiﬁed versions developed for investigation of microbial lipids, as well as the advantages and limitations of each. Current modiﬁcations to standard methods show a number of improvements for each of the different steps associated with analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of lipid analysis compared to other popular techniques are clariﬁed. Accordingly, the preferential utilization of signature lipid biomarker analysis in current research is considered. It is clear from recent literature that this technique stays relevant – mainly for the variety of microbial properties that can be determined in a single analysis.",

The present study showed that the predominant fatty acid was 15:0i followed by 15:0a, which were characteristic of Bacillus. The results suggest that the order of decreasing abundance of terminally branched fatty acids is as follows: iso even-numbered acids namely 16:0i, 14:0i, iso odd-numbered acids, 15:0i, 17:0i, 13:0i, 19:0i and anteiso acids, 15:0a, 17:0a, 11:0a, 19:0a. Straight chain saturated fatty acids identified were 10:0, 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0. The remaining fatty acids components were present in negligible quantities. The isolates were also identified and classified using the comparison with the TSBA database as B. cereus-GC subgroup A (isolates ASR 29CIII, ASR 37CIII), B. subtilis (isolates ASR 6SII, ASR 21SI, ASR 25SV), B. laevolacticus (isolates ASR 4LIII, ASR 7SIII, ASR 11LVI, ASR 42SVII), B. alcalophilus (isolates ASR 14PI, ASR 18PIV), B. pumilus subgroup A (isolate- ASR 41PVIII), Staphylococcus schleiferi (isolates- ASR 2LII, ASR 5LIV), S. gallinarum-GC subgroup A (isolates ASR 13SIV, ASR 33SVI), Kurthia sibirica (isolate ASR 15PII), Geobacillus stearothermophilus-GC subgroup (isolate ASR 8LV).",

Total lipids were extracted from oleaginous yeast (Rhodotorula glutinis) using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE). The effects of extraction parameters on lipid extraction yield were studied by employing a second-order central composite design. The optimal condition was obtained as three cycles of 15min at 100°C with a ratio of 144g of hydromatrix per 100g of dry cell weight. Different analysis methods were used to compare the optimized PLE method with two conventional methods (Soxhlet and modification of Bligh and Dyer methods) under efficiency, selectivity and reproducibility criteria thanks to gravimetric analysis, GC with flame ionization detector, High Performance Liquid Chromatography linked to Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (HPLC-ELSD) and thin-layer chromatographic analysis. For each sample, the lipid extraction yield with optimized PLE was higher than those obtained with referenced methods (Soxhlet and Bligh and Dyer methods with, respectively, a recovery of 78% and 85% compared to PLE method). Moreover, the use of PLE led to major advantages such as an analysis time reduction by a factor of 10 and solvent quantity reduction by 70%, compared with traditional extraction methods.",

		"abstract": "Microbial communities are important drivers and regulators of ecosystem processes. To understand how management of ecosystems may affect microbial communities, a relatively precise but effort-intensive technique to assay microbial community composition is phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. PLFA was developed to analyze phospholipid biomarkers, which can be used as indicators of microbial biomass and the composition of broad functional groups of fungi and bacteria. It has commonly been used to compare soils under alternative plant communities, ecology, and management regimes. The PLFA method has been shown to be sensitive to detecting shifts in microbial community composition. An alternative method, fatty acid methyl ester extraction and analysis (MIDI-FA) was developed for rapid extraction of total lipids, without separation of the phospholipid fraction, from pure cultures as a microbial identification technique. This method is rapid but is less suited for soil samples because it lacks an initial step separating soil particles and begins instead with a saponification reaction that likely produces artifacts from the background organic matter in the soil. This article describes a method that increases throughput while balancing effort and accuracy for extraction of lipids from the cell membranes of microorganisms for use in characterizing both total lipids and the relative abundance of indicator lipids to determine soil microbial community structure in studies with many samples. The method combines the accuracy achieved through PLFA profiling by extracting and concentrating soil lipids as a first step, and a reduction in effort by saponifying the organic material extracted and processing with the MIDI-FA method as a second step.",

Two organic layers (moss and F1) as well as two mineral soil horizons (EA and C1) were sampled and extracted with DCM/MeOH (93:7 v/v) by ASE at 75 °C and a pressure of 6.9 · 10 6 Pa or 17 · 10 6 Pa. Soxhlet extractions were used as the established reference method. After clean-up and derivatization with BSTFA, the extracts were analyzed on GC/MS. Using Soxhlet as a reference, we found ASE to extract all compounds adequately. The n-alkanes, especially, were found to be extracted very efficiently from all horizons studied. Only the n-fatty acids and b-sitosterol from the organic layers seemed to be extracted at a slightly lower efficiency by ASE. In all but two instances the relative abundance of extracted lipids within a component class was the same regardless of the extraction method used. Using a higher pressure in the ASE extractions significantly increased the extraction efficiency for all component classes in the moss layer, except b-sitosterol. The effect was most pronounced for the n-alkanes. In the EA horizon, a higher pres-sure slightly reduced the extraction efficiency for dehydroabietic acid. The observed differences between ASE and Soxhlet extractions as well as the pressure effect can be explained by a decrease in polarity of the extractant due to the elevated pressure and temperature applied during ASE extractions as compared to Soxhlet extractions. This would mainly increase the extraction efficiency of the least polar biomarkers: the n-alkanes as was observed. In addition, a better penetration of still partially water-filled micro pores under elevated pressure and temperature may have played a role.",

		"abstract": "Analysis of soil lipids may contribute to an improved understanding of atmosphere to soil carbon fluxes, soil organic matter source differentiation and pollutant accumulation. Soil lipids, mostly originating from plants and microorganisms, have traditionally been analysed by non-automated extraction and separation methods, which produce several lipid fractions, operationally defined by polarity. Here we present a combination of fast, automated and reproducible techniques, adopted from organic geochemical studies, for preparative separation of individual soil lipid fractions with increasing polarity. These techniques involve commercially available instruments, including accelerated solvent extraction and a two-step automated medium-pressure liquid chromatography procedure. The method yields eight lipid fractions consisting of five fractions fully amenable to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids), and three fractions of highly polar or high molecular weight compounds (bases, very long-chain wax esters (C40+), high polarity compounds) that were not measurable with GC/MS under standard conditions. We tested the method on five agricultural soils. Results show that (i) mass recoveries for the individual fractions are reproducible, (ii) within individual fractions compound distribution patterns are reproducible, as demonstrated for alkanes and carboxylic acids, and (iii) individual fractions represent distinct and clean compound classes, free of interfering substances detectable by GC/MS. Thus, automated separation can be a fast, effective and reproducible procedure for fractionation of complex mixtures of soil lipids into clean compound classes, directly suitable for a variety of molecular (e.g. GC/MS) and isotopic characterizations (e.g. gas chromatography coupled with isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry or accelerator mass spectrometry).",

The hydrophobic nature of such compounds may increase their stabilization potential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of aliphatic compounds in mineral soil horizons along a Dystric Cambisol profile under beech forest to increase hydrophobicity. The conceptual approach included the analyses of soil samples before and after solvent extraction and base hydrolysis for elemental and isotopic composition. Additionally, the advancing contact angle was measured to quantify hydrophobicity. Curie-point pyrolysis GC/MS was carried out to characterize the nature of alkyl C present in subsoil samples. A close correlation between the 14C activity and the stable-C-isotope ratio (δ13C) indicates isotopic fractionation upon C stabilization in subsoils. Free lipids contributed less than 10% to the organic C found in subsoil horizons. Base hydrolysis revealed very high amounts of hydroxyalkanoic acids in the B horizons of the acid forest soil. Hydrophobicity of SOM was not found to be correlated to esterified- or free-lipid content. The contact angle was in a similar range for all bulk soil horizons, suggesting greater hydrophobicity of organic matter in subsoil horizons considering their very low concentrations of organic C compared to the A horizon. The quantity and nature of pyrolysis products change with increasing depth in the soil profile. Aliphatic products cannot be detected in B and C horizons by Curie-point pyrolysis GC/MS.",

		"abstract": "Abstract. Microphytobenthos and benthic macroalgae play an important role in system metabolism within shallow coastal bays. However, their independent and interactive influences on sediment organic matter (SOM) are not well understood. We investigated the influence of macroalgae and microphytobenthos on SOM quantity and quality in an experimental mesocosm system using bulk and molecular level (total hydrolyzable amino acids, THAA; phospholipid linked fatty acids, PLFA; pigment) analyses. Our experiment used an incomplete factorial design made up of two factors, each with two levels: (1) light (ambient vs. dark) and (2) macroalgae (presence vs. absence of live macroalgae). Over the course of the 42-day experiment, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) increased under ambient light by 173 ± 14 and 141 ± 7%, respectively, compared to in the dark (78 ± 29 and 39 ± 22%). THAA comprised a substantial fraction of SOM (~ 16% of TOC, 35% of TN) and followed TOC and TN accumulation patterns. Mole percent composition of the THAA pool indicated that SOM was composed of more labile organic material (e.g., L-glutamic acid, phenylalanine) under ambient light conditions while SOM in dark treatments was more degraded, with higher proportions of glycine and D-alanine. PLFA content, which represents viable biomass, made up ~ 1% of TOC and contained high levels of algal fatty acids in the light, particularly PLFA derived from diatoms. In the presence of microphytobenthos (i.e., light and macroalgae treatments), SOM lability increased, resulting in the observed increases in bacterial PLFA concentrations. Macroalgae, which were added to half of the light treatments, decreased SOM accumulation compared to light treatments without macroalgae, with TOC and TN increasing by only 130 ± 32 and 94 ± 24%, respectively. This decrease likely resulted from shading by macroalgae, which reduced production of microphytobenthos. The presence of macroalgae decreased SOM lability as well, which resulted in diminished buildup of bacterial biomass. By the final day of the experiment, principal component analysis revealed that sediment composition in treatments with macroalgae was more similar to dark treatments and less similar to light treatments without macroalgae. Overall, microphytobenthos and benthic macroalgae fundamentally altered SOM quality and quantity, which may have notable ecological consequences for shallow-water systems such as increased hypoxia/anoxia, sulfide accumulation, enhanced mineralization and/or stimulated denitrification.",

		"abstract": "The extraction and transesterification of soil lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is a useful technique for studying soil microbial communities. The objective of this study was to find the best solvent mixture to extract soil lipids with a pressurized solvent extractor system. Four solvent mixtures were selected for testing: chloroform:methanol:phosphate buffer (1:2:0.8, v/v/v), chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v), hexane:2-propanol (3:2, v/v) and acetone. Soils were from agricultural fields and had a wide range of clay, organic matter and microbial biomass contents. Total lipid fatty acid methyl esters (TL-FAMEs) were the extractable soil lipids identified and quantified with gas chromatography and flame ionization detection. Concentrations of TL-FAMEs ranged from 57.3 to 542.2nmoleg−1 soil (dry weight basis). The highest concentrations of TL-FAMEs were extracted with chloroform:methanol:buffer or chloroform:methanol mixtures than with the hexane:2-propanol or acetone solvents. The concentrations of TL-FAMEs in chemical groups, including saturated, branched, mono- and poly-unsaturated and hydroxy fatty acids were assessed, and biological groups (soil bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, saprophytic fungi and higher plants) was distinguished. The extraction efficiency for the chemical and biological groups followed the general trend of: chloroform:methanol:buffer≥chloroform:methanol>hexane:2-propanol=acetone. Discriminant analysis revealed differences in TL-FAME profiles based on the solvent mixture and the soil type. Although solvent mixtures containing chloroform and methanol were the most efficient for extracting lipids from the agricultural soils in this study, soil properties and the lipid groups to be studied should be considered when selecting a solvent mixture. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of soil lipid extraction with hexane:2-propanol or acetone in a pressurized solvent extraction system.",

		"abstract": "Soil and rhizosphere microbial communities in agroecosystems may be affected by soil, climate, plant species, and management. The management and environmental factors controlling microbial biomass and community structure were identified in a three-year field experiment. The experiment consisted of a tomato production agroecosystem with the following nine treatments: bare soil, black polyethylene mulch, white polyethylene mulch, vetch cover crop, vetch roots only, vetch shoots only, rye cover crop, rye roots only, and rye shoots only. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Temperature and moisture differences between polyethylene-covered and cover-cropped treatments are partly responsible for treatment effects on soil microbial community composition, and (2) Different species of cover crops have unique root and shoot effects on soil microbial community composition. Microbial biomass and community composition were measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Microbial biomass was increased by all cover crop treatments, including root only and shoot only. Cover cropping increased the absolute amount of all microbial groups, but Gram-positive bacteria decreased in proportion under cover crops. We attribute this decrease to increased readily available carbon under cover-cropped treatments, which favored other groups over Gram-positive bacteria. Higher soil temperatures under certain treatments also increased the proportion of Gram-positive bacteria. Vetch shoots increased the amount and proportion of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. The imposed treatments were much more significant than soil temperature, moisture, pH, and texture in controlling microbial biomass and community structure.",

		"abstract": "Native North American prairie grasslands are renowned for the richness of their soils, having excellent soil structure and very high organic content and microbial biomass. In this study, surface soils from three prairie restorations of varying ages and plant community compositions were compared with a nearby undisturbed native prairie remnant and a cropped agricultural field in terms of soil physical, chemical and microbial properties. Soil moisture, organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfur, C:N, water-holding capacity and microbial biomass (total PLFA) were significantly greater (p<0.05) in the virgin prairie remnant as well as the two long-term (21 and 24 year) prairie restorations, compared with the agricultural field and the restoration that was begun more recently (7 years prior to sampling). Soil bulk density was significantly greater (p<0.05) in the agricultural and recently restored sites. In most cases, the soil quality indicators and microbial community structures in the restoration sites were intermediate between those of the virgin prairie and the agricultural sites. Levels of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PLFA indicators of nutritional stress were significantly greater (p<0.05) in the agricultural and recent restoration sites than in the long-term restorations or the native prairie. Samples could be assigned to the correct site by discriminant analysis of the PLFA data, with the exception that the two long-term restoration sites overlapped. Redundancy analysis showed that prairie age (p<0.005) was the most important environmental factor in determining the PLFA microbial community composition, with C:N (p<0.015) also being significant. These findings demonstrate that prairie restorations can lead to improved quality of surface soils. We predict that the conversion of farmland into prairie will shift the soil quality, microbial community biomass and microbial community composition in the direction of native prairies, but with the restoration methods tested it may take many decades to approach the levels found in a virgin prairie throughout the soil profile.",

A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared.\n\nResults\nMethods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data.\n\nConclusions\nIn highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, “Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?”",

		"abstract": "Though variable selection is one of the most relevant tasks in microbiome analysis, e.g. for the identification of microbial signatures, many studies still rely on methods that ignore the compositional nature of microbiome data. The applicability of compositional data analysis methods has been hampered by the availability of software and the difficulty in interpreting their results. This work is focused on three methods for variable selection that acknowledge the compositional structure of microbiome data: selbal, a forward selection approach for the identification of compositional balances, and clr-lasso and coda-lasso, two penalized regression models for compositional data analysis. This study highlights the link between these methods and brings out some limitations of the centered log-ratio transformation for variable selection. In particular, the fact that it is not subcompositionally consistent makes the microbial signatures obtained from clr-lasso not readily transferable. Coda-lasso is computationally efficient and suitable when the focus is the identification of the most associated microbial taxa. Selbal stands out when the goal is to obtain a parsimonious model with optimal prediction performance, but it is computationally greedy. We provide a reproducible vignette for the application of these methods that will enable researchers to fully leverage their potential in microbiome studies.",

These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual’s specific microbiota., High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized microbiome research by allowing the relative quantification of microbiome composition and function in different environments. In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn’s microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study., IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures.

		"abstract": "Wood ash amendment to forest soils contributes to the sustainability of the growing bioenergy industry, not only through decreased wood ash waste disposal in landfills but also by increasing soil/site productivity and tree growth. However, tree growth studies to date have reported variable responses to wood ash, highlighting the need to identify proper application rates under various soil/site conditions to maximize their benefits. We explored the influence of tree species, wood ash nutrient application rates, time since application, stand development stage, and initial (i.e., before wood ash application) soil pH and N on short‐term tree growth response to wood ash amendment across eight unique study sites spanning five Canadian Provinces. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) had the most positive response to wood ash amendment compared to white (Picea glauca Moench), hybrid (Picea engelmannii x glauca Parry), and black spruce (Picea mariana Miller), where increasing nutrient application rates increased height growth response. In comparison, black spruce had the most negative response to wood ash amendment, where increasing nutrient application rates slightly decreased height growth response. Site as a random effect explained additional variation, highlighting the importance of other unidentified site characteristics. By examining trends in short‐term growth response across multiple studies with variable site characteristics, we found growth response differed by tree species and nutrient application rates, and that jack pine is a promising candidate for wood ash amendment. These results contribute to our knowledge of optimal wood ash amendment practices and environmentally sustainable bioenergy production.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nThe ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted.\nMethods\nWe show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.\nResults\nThe Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive identifications.\nConclusions\nThe CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets.",

		"abstract": "Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.",

		"abstract": "Anthropogenic N deposition affects litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) storage through multiple mechanisms. Microbial community responses to long-term N deposition were investigated in a sugar maple-dominated forest in northern Michigan during the 1998–2000 growing seasons. Litter and soil were collected from three fertilized plots (30kg N ha−1y−1) and three control plots. The activities of 10 extracellular enzymes (EEA) were assayed. ANOVA and meta-analysis techniques were used to compare treatment responses. EEA responses to N amendment were greater in litter than in soil (litter mean effect size [d]=0.534 std. dev.; soil d=0.308). Urease, acid phosphatase and glycosidase (β-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, β-xylosidase) activities increased in both soil and litter; mean responses ranged from 7 to 56%. N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity increased 14% in soil but decreased 4% in litter. Phenol oxidase activity dropped 40% in soil, but increased 63% in litter. These responses suggest that N deposition has increased litter decomposition rate and depressed SOM decomposition. In previous studies, loss of phenol oxidase activity in response to N deposition has been attributed to suppression of lignin-degrading basidiomycetes. However, the decline of this activity in bacterially-dominated soil suggest that N inhibition of recalcitrant organic matter decomposition may be a more general phenomenon.",

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95%) and high accuracy (98%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ .",

We compiled nearly 1 million CO1 barcode sequences appropriate for classifying arthropods and chordates. Compared to our previous Insecta classifier, the current classifier has more than three times the taxonomic coverage, including outgroups, and is based on almost five times as many reference sequences. Unlike other popular rDNA metabarcoding markers, we show that classification performance is similar across the length of the CO1 barcoding region. We show that the RDP classifier can make taxonomic assignments about 19 times faster than the popular top BLAST hit method and reduce the false positive rate from nearly 100% to 34%. This is especially important in large-scale biodiversity and biomonitoring studies where datasets can become very large and the taxonomic assignment problem is not trivial. We also show that reference databases are becoming more representative of current species diversity but that gaps still exist. We suggest that it would benefit the field as a whole if all investigators involved in metabarocoding studies, through collaborations with taxonomic experts, also planned to barcode representatives of their local biota as a part of their projects.",

		"abstract": "<h3>Abstract</h3> <h3>Background</h3> <p>Multi-marker metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate biodiversity information across different domains of life from microbes to fungi to animals such as in ecological and environmental studies. Current popular bioinformatic pipelines support microbial and fungal marker analysis, while ad hoc methods are used to process animal metabarcode markers from the same study. The purpose of this paper is to introduce MetaWorks, a ‘meta’barcode pipeline that does ‘the works’ and supports the bioinformatic processing of various metabarcoding markers including rRNA and their spacers as well as protein coding loci.</p><h3>Results</h3> <p>MetaWorks provides a Conda environment to quickly gather most of the programs and dependencies for the pipeline. MetaWorks is automated using Snakemake to ensure reproducibility and scalability. We have supplemented existing RDP-trained classifiers for SSU (prokaryotes), ITS (fungi), and LSU (fungi) with trained classifiers for COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (diatoms or eukaryotes), SSU (diatoms or eukaryotes), and 12S (fish). MetaWorks can process rRNA genes, but it can also properly handle ITS spacers by trimming flanking conserved rRNA gene regions, as well as handle protein coding genes by removing obvious pseudogenes.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3> <p>As far as we are aware, MetaWorks is the first flexible multi-marker metabarcode pipeline that can accommodate rRNA genes, spacer, and protein coding markers in the same pipeline. This is ideal for large-scale, multi-marker studies to provide a harmonized processing environment, pipeline, and taxonomic assignment approach. Updates to MetaWorks will be made as needed to reflect advances in the underlying programs, reference databases, or hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles for pseudogene filtering. Future developments will include support for additional metabarcode markers, RDP trained reference databases, and HMM profiles for pseudogene filtering.</p>",

		"abstract": "In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits) interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be achieved by exploring the trait–environment relationships of non-sessile, heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification, conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of ‘terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology’ have not been well established. Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural, and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire, floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation. We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait–environment relationships to explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.",

		"abstract": "Thanks to sequencing technology, modern molecular bioscience datasets are often compositions of counts, e.g. counts of amplicons, mRNAs, etc. While there is growing appreciation that compositional data need special analysis and interpretation, less well understood is the discrete nature of these count compositions (or, as we call them, lattice compositions) and the impact this has on statistical analysis, particularly log-ratio analysis (LRA) of pairwise association. While LRA methods are scale-invariant, count compositional data are not; consequently, the conclusions we draw from LRA of lattice compositions depend on the scale of counts involved. We know that additive variation affects the relative abundance of small counts more than large counts; here we show that additive (quantization) variation comes from the discrete nature of count data itself, as well as (biological) variation in the system under study and (technical) variation from measurement and analysis processes. Variation due to quantization is inevitable, but its impact on conclusions depends on the underlying scale and distribution of counts. We illustrate the different distributions of real molecular bioscience data from different experimental settings to show why it is vital to understand the distributional characteristics of count data before applying and drawing conclusions from compositional data analysis methods.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we summarize Ontario’s Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) experience focusing on our efforts to forge lasting research partnerships, highlight the approaches we feel were effective in getting emerging science into forest policy within an adaptive management (AM) framework, and describe the future direction of Ontario’s LTSP program as new policy issues are emerging as part of the continuous AM cycle. Fourteen installations were established on nutrient-poor, coniferdominated sites, considered to be the most sensitive to increased biomass removals. From 1993 to 1995, all sites were clearcut-harvested, with replicated (three reps per site) biomass removal treatments that included: stem only, full-tree, and full-tree + forest floor removal. Routine (every 5 years) measurements have been carried out to track changes in soil carbon and nutrient levels, as well as stand- and individual-tree growth and development metrics and foliar nutrition.The published results from Ontario’s LTSP program, in combination with the North American-wide LTSP synthesis outputs, have suggested that these nutrient-poor, conifer-dominated sites are less sensitive to biomass (nutrient) removals than previously thought. The evidence provided through peerreviewed publications, conference and workshop presentations, and field tours was substantive and led to a review and revision of the full-tree logging direction within Ontario’s guidelines. We conclude with a set of recommendations (lessons learned) for the successful delivery of any new long-term, interdisciplinary research projects examining the sustainability of forest-management practices.",

		"abstract": "Harvest impact on forest biodiversity has been widely studied, but for managers confronted with a need for integrated cross-taxa assessment, application remains a significant challenge. Using post-harvest boreal forest succession as a model system, we investigate the usefulness of a trait-based multi-taxa approach to improve our understanding of the community dynamics after disturbance. We assess the strength of response to forest harvesting and recovery patterns of four taxa with contrasting attributes (vegetation, carabids, spiders and birds) along a post-harvest chronosequence of jack pine stands in the boreal forests of Canada. We used a complementary set of functional and taxonomic diversity metrics to identify commonalities and dissimilarities in the community assembly processes and sensitivities to harvesting among taxa. Despite the overall similarity of community response for most pairs of taxa and metrics, the strength of cross-taxa congruency varied greatly among metrics, illustrating the complexity of taxa response to harvest as well as the necessity of including a variety of biodiversity metrics in impact assessments. Of the four selected taxa, spiders were found the most sensitive to harvesting, with a strong response to environmental changes after harvest and a slow community recovery process. Birds and carabids showed highly congruent response patterns, with a strong response to harvest followed by a marked recovery process. Ground vegetation was the most resilient to harvesting. We discuss the management implications of these contrasting recovery processes, outline the current limitations of this method and suggest steps toward the implementation of effective integrated multi-taxa monitoring programs.",

Wood ash additions to soil are typically used to combat soil acidification, and it is unclear whether wood ash additions to upland soils will lead to higher Ca leaching to surface waters. In this study we applied fly ash or bottom ash at 4 Mg ha −1 and 8 Mg ha −1 to upland soils at replicated plots in Haliburton Forest in central Ontario and measured soil water chemistry at 3 depths over 4 years. Increases in soil water Ca concentration following application were quite modest and occurred primarily in the fly ash treatments in the upper depth (0.3 m) during the first 2 years following application. There was no concomi-tant increase in pH or acid-neutralizing capacity primarily because of the high sulphate leaching associated with the fly ash treatments. Overall, these results show that wood ash addition to soils at moderate doses will have little impact on soil export to lakes.",

This method has been used for more than 35 years and is still popular as a means to characterize microbial communities in a diverse range of environmental matrices. This review examines the various recent applications of PLFA analysis in environmental studies with specific reference to the interpretation of the PLFA results. It is evident that interpretations of PLFA results do not always correlate between different investigations. These discrepancies in interpretation and their subsequent applications to environmental studies are discussed. However, in spite of limitations to the manner in which PLFA data are applied, the approach remains one with great potential for improving our understanding of the relationship between microbial populations and the environment.

These studies share a common experimental design while encompassing a wide range of climate, site conditions, and forest types. Whole-tree harvest had limited effects on planted seedling performance compared with the effects of stem-only harvest (the control); slight increases in survival were usually offset by decreases in growth. Forest-floor removal improved seedling survival and increased growth in Mediterranean climates, but reduced growth on productive, nutrient-limited, warm–humid sites. Soil compaction with intact forest floors usually benefited conifer survival and growth, regardless of climate or species. Compaction combined with forest-floor removal generally increased survival, had limited effects on individual tree growth, and increased stand growth in Mediterranean climates. Vegetation control benefited seedling growth in all treatments, particularly on more productive sites, but did not affect survival or alter the relative impact of organic matter removal and compaction on growth. Organic matter removal increased aspen coppice densities and, as with compaction, reduced aspen growth.",

Two wood-derived bottom ashes (low-carbon gasifier ash and high-carbon boiler ash) were applied at 5000 kg ha−1 (dry weight equivalent) with urea (100 kg N ha−1), in a twoway factorial randomized block design across two (18- and 24-yr-old) hybrid spruce (Picea glauca × engelmannii Parry × Engelm.) plantations in interior British Columbia. Changes in spruce foliar nutrients and selected soil properties were evaluated. After one growing season, foliar Ca and S significantly increased in plots treated with ash, and foliar N significantly increased while foliar Mg and P significantly decreased in spruce treated with urea. In LFH horizons, soil pH, exchangeable base cations (Ca, Mg, and K), strong acid-extractable B, and Ca significantly increased (p < 0.05) with ash addition; soil pH was greatest in plots treated with urea plus gasifier ash. No significant treatment effects were observed in underlying mineral soil. We conclude that gasifier and boiler ash derived from clean wood applied at 5000 kg ha−1 are effective soil amendments as expressed within 1 yr by changes in nutrient status of LFH horizons and spruce foliage.",

Plots were established with ﬂy ash and bottom ash treatments of 0, 1, 4, and 8 Mg·ha−1 (n = 4), and cover boards were positioned both with and without ash beneath. One year following ash additions, salamander abundance had increased under boards with ﬂy ash beneath, and bottom ash had no effect. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased under cover boards with ash beneath them and for uncovered soil, and the effects were strongest under cover boards with ash beneath. The effects of ash were generally stronger at higher dosages, and ﬂy ash was stronger than bottom ash. The moisture holding capacity of ﬂy ash was 60% higher than the soil and was 63% lower than the soil for bottom ash, but they had little effect on moisture of the forest ﬂoor. These results suggest that ash altered salamander abundance via soil pH and moisture and would not inhibit salamander movement over the forest ﬂoor.",

Less attention has been paid to the ash generated when forest biomass is combusted to produce energy. In Canada, this ash is often landfilled, but in some countries, wood ash is applied to the soil to maintain or improve soil fertility and forest health. AshNet is a network of Canadian scientists, foresters, policy makers and industry representatives that has formed to address opportunities for and challenges to the use of wood ash as a forest soil amendment. To date, AshNet collaborators have produced a guide to navigating the regulatory approval process, and completed a techno-economic analysis of the costs associated with landfilling wood ash versus using it as a forest soil amendment. Practical methods for optimizing ash quality and applying it on forested sites are being investigated. Applications of wood ash are also being examined as a tool for emulating some of the effects of wildfire on soil chemistry. The results of research trials established by AshNet collaborators across Canada will be shared to help develop and refine forest management policies and practices surrounding soil applications of wood ash. Updates on AshNet’s activities are available at (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/140 (English); http://scf.rncan.gc.ca/projets/140?lang=fr_CA (French)).",

		"abstract": "The contribution of forest biomass to Canada’s energy production is small but growing. As the forest bioenergy industry in Canada expands, there is growing interest in more sustainably managing the wood ash that is generated as a by-product. Despite being rich in nutrients, wood ash is usually landﬁlled in Canada. Soil applications of ash in Canadian forests could be used to mimic some of the effects of wildﬁre, to replace nutrients removed during harvesting, to counteract the negative effects of acid deposition, and to improve tree growth. At present, the provincial and territorial processes for obtaining regulatory approval to use wood ash as a forest soil amendment can be challenging to navigate. Furthermore, the costs for obtaining approval and transporting and applying wood ash to the soil can render landﬁlling a more cost-effective method of ash management. To ensure that wood ash applications in Canadian forests are conducted safely, effectively, and efﬁciently, experience from European countries could provide a useful starting point for developing best practices. The results of Canadian research trials will assist policy makers and forest managers in reﬁning management guidelines that encourage soil applications of wood ash as a forest management tool while protecting the ecology, water quality, biodiversity, and productivity of Canadian forests.",

Two hybrid spruce (Picea glauca X engelmannii) plantations in interior British Columbia were treated with two types of bioenergy-produced wood ash (high carbon boiler ash and low carbon gasifier ash) with or without nitrogen fertilizer in a two-way factorial block design. Ash and nitrogen treatments were applied to 8.0 m radius plots at a rate of 5000 kg ha-1 loose ash (dry basis), and 100 kg N ha-1 of urea in pellet form. Changes in understory vegetation cover were observed. There was a significant (p<0.05) effect of nitrogen and wood ash plus nitrogen application on understory vegetation community composition, with nitrogen application having the greatest effect. Discriminant function analysis indicated a differential response of species group to ash/ nitrogen treatments, though the effect size was small. We conclude that short-term changes to understory vegetation are minimal when these two ashes were applied at a rate of 5000 kg ha-1. Continued monitoring will determine if any long-term effects become apparent with time.",

		"abstract": "The burning of wood for bioenergy produces signiﬁcant amounts of ash residue that requires disposal. We constructed a cost model to evaluate the unit costs of three ash disposal methods in the Canadian context: landﬁlls owned and operated by the bioenergy facility, municipal landﬁlls, and forest site application. The model accounts for costs related to the pretreatment, transportation, and disposal of ash at a landﬁll or forest site. Model parameter values were assigned appropriate distributions (based on published literature and industry surveys), and Monte Carlo simulations were employed to produce a range of model outputs for each disposal option. Results indicate that existing landﬁlls (if available for ash disposal) are likely the most cost-effective option (median value of $77 per tonne), although applying ash to a forest site is only ϳ15%–20% more costly (median value of $92 per tonne). Indeed, the unit cost estimates across disposal options have considerable overlap. This suggests that close examination of ﬁrm-speciﬁc circumstances is highly warranted when choosing a disposal approach, even in the absence of accounting for potential environmental beneﬁts associated with forest site disposal of ash.",

We added wood ash and biochar to microcosms containing three acidic Ontario soils planted with red pine or sugar maple seedlings and observed seedling growth responses, as well as amendmentinduced changes in soil P pools, microbial P, and enzyme activity. Neither ash nor biochar consistently increased seedling growth; instead sugar maple and red pine seedlings often had opposing responses to the same amendment–soil combination. Overall, these results indicate that it is important to carefully consider both the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil and the ash or biochar, as well as the nutrient requirements of the target tree species, to effectively use these amendments to reduce P limitation.",

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate soil chemistry, in particular soil acidity, after the application of three alkaline residuals from the pulp and paper industry, and (2) to determine if these alkaline residuals altered soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a result of the change in soil pH or due to their chemical composition. Soil properties and GHG fluxes were monitored for two years after alkaline residuals were applied to six forest sites dominated by sugar maple in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Each site received six treatments: wood ash applied at 5, 10 and 20 t ha-1, lime mud (7.5 t ha-1), a mixture of slaker grits and green liquor sludge (7 t ha-1) and an unamended control. These treatments had acid-neutralizing power from 0 to 9 t ha-1. All alkaline residuals buffered soil acidity as a function of their neutralizing power, and more neutralization occurred in the forest floor layer than in the underlying mineral soil. In the forest floor, the alkaline residual treatments significantly increased pH by more than one unit, nearly doubled the base saturation, and reduced exchangeable acidity, Al and Fe concentrations compared to control plots. The CO2 and N2O fluxes were lower after application of alkaline residuals, and this was related to the soil pH increase and the type of alkaline residual applied. Lime mud was more effective at reducing GHG fluxes than other alkaline residuals. We conclude that these alkaline residuals can effectively counteract soil acidity in sugar maple forests without increasing soil GHG emissions, at least in the short term.",

The disposal of wood ash and/or pulp and paper mill sludges is becoming increasingly more challenging as landfills are more difficult to site due to diminishing land availability and public opposition, as well as more costly to construct and operate because of increasingly stringent regulations. The most notable alternative to disposal that is receiving the attention of the forest industry is land application. The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine the influence of applying a pulp mill wood/sludge ash mixture on 1) various soil chemical properties of an Orthic Gray Luvisol and 2) the growth and nutrient uptake of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] seedlings. The pulp mill wood/sludge ash mixture from an olivine burner was surface broadcast at rates of 1 and 5 Mg ha–1 around white spruce seedlings planted on disc-trenched microsites. Soil solutions from lysimeters and soil samples were analyzed for exchangeable elements, soil pH and electrical conductivity while white spruce tissue samples were analyzed for various elements. Applications of pulp mill wood/sludge ash material significantly increased the soil pH from 4.8 to 6.9, resulting in increased soil extractable and soil solution P, Ca, and Mg. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was increased from about 0.02 dS m–1 to approximately 0.10 dS m–1 by the heavier application rate of ash. In addition, at higher ash application rates, white spruce seedling growth was significantly decreased, suggesting salt phytotoxicity effects from the ash. These results indicate that with proper rate determination and management of salt effects, land application of this material would not appear to pose serious problems for white spruce seedling establishment.",

We investigated the feasibility of using small, mainly residential sources of non-industrial wood ash (NIWA) for this purpose by quantifying concentrations of its major nutrients and metals, its toxicity to Daphnia in aqueous extracts, and estimating the amount of NIWA available in the District of Muskoka in central Ontario. Locally collected NIWA averaged 30% Ca, and also contained smaller but significant amounts of K, Mg, Na, and P. Of these, K was so soluble that it was toxic to Daphnia over 48 h in the concentrate and 10-fold dilution; however, sedimented ash was not toxic over 15 d. Most metal levels in NIWA were below targets permitting unrestricted land application. However, Cu and Zn were just above these targets, but well below those for conditional use. Muskoka residents generate about 235 000 kg of NIWA annually, not enough to treat all central Ontario areas affected; however, a NIWA recycling programme implemented across southern Ontario could generate enough ash to solve the Ca decline problem in Muskoka’s forests and lakes.",

Fungal rhizomorphs and mycelia were sampled from sand-filled mesh bags with or without amendment of apatite or wood ash. The mesh bags were buried in forest soil in the field for 13 or 24 months. Elemental composition of the samples was analyzed with particle-induced X-ray emission and the fungus was identified by polymerase chain reaction^restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ITS-region of ribosomal DNA. The majority of rhizomorphs and mycelia collected from the mesh bags were of mycorrhizal origin with Paxillus involutus being the most common species (31%). Other identified species were Thelephora terrestris, Suillus granulatus and Tylospora fibillosa. S. granulatus contained 3^15 times more K (3 mg g31) than the other species and had large calcium-rich crystals deposited on the surface of rhizomorphs when grown in contact with apatite. P. involutus contained the largest amount of Ca (2^7 mg g31). Wood ash addition increased the amount of Ti, Mn and Pb in the rhizomorphs while apatite addition increased the amount of Ca in the rhizomorphs. The high concentration of K in S. granulatus rhizomorphs suggests that this fungus is a good accumulator of K while P. involutus appeared to accumulate heavy metals originating from wood ash.",

		"abstract": "Forest soil from an experimental Norway spruce forest with four levels of wood ash addition (0, 1, 3 and 6 tonnes ha−1) was used to inoculate pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings with indigenous ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Uptake of 32P and 86Rb in a root bioassay was used to estimate the demand for P and K by seedlings grown in the different soils. Utilisation of P from apatite was tested in a laboratory system where uptake by the ectomycorrhizal mycelium was separated from uptake by roots. The demand for P and K in the seedlings was similar regardless of the ash treatment. Variation in EM levels, estimated as fungal biomass (ergosterol) in roots, was large in the different soils, but not related to ash addition. Uptake of P from apatite was, on average, 23% of total seedling P and was not related to EM levels. It was concluded that the improved P uptake from apatite by EM fungi found in earlier studies is probably not a general phenomenon among EM fungi. The small effect of ash addition on EM levels and P uptake suggests that addition of granulated wood ash is a forest management treatment that will have only minor influence on ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.",

In addition to control plots, three treatments were tested: granulated wood ash at 4150 kg dry weight (dw) ha(1, a nitrogen-free, dolomite-based vitality fertilizer (SkogVital) at 2 )1500 kg ha(1 and the fine fraction of harvest residues (mostly needles) at 15,050 kg dw ha(1. The treatments had no short-term effect on height increment. Nitrogen (N) was probably the growth-limiting element, but phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were also in suboptimum supply. The vitality fertilizer increased the foliar concentration (or the element/N ratio) of P, calcium (Ca) and zinc, while ash application increased the foliar Ca/N ratio. The vitality fertilizer also increased magnesium and Ca concentrations in roots and decreased aluminium concentrations, whereas logging residues and wood ash only increased manganese concentrations in roots. Thus, the vitality fertilizer had a more marked effect on tree nutrient status than the granulated wood ash.",

		"abstract": "Wildfires may produce several changes in the short- and longterm in the landscape and in the soil system. The magnitude of these changes induced by fire in the components of ecosystems (water, soil, vegetation and fauna) depends on fire properties (fire intensity and severity) and environmental factors (vegetation, soil, geomorphology, etc.). The most important impacts on soils in the short-term are the reduction of vegetation cover (which increases soil erosion risk), the deposition of ash after combustion of biomass, the induction of enhancement of water repellency and changes in the structure and soil components. Combustion of biomass and soil organic matter also results in the release of gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Similarly, the changes induced by fire on the biological soil components (vegetation, animals and soil microorganisms) may occur rapidly and produce a large-scale response. The long-term effects of fire on soils and water may well persist for relatively short periods (hours, days or months), long (years or tens of years), or be permanent depending on the severity of fire and fire regime. Some of these effects are a consequence of the relationship between fire, soil, hydrology and nutrient cycling.",

		"abstract": "We examined the effect of wood ash (WA) fertilization on microbial processes in the mineral top soil (0 –5 cm) of an acidic Norway spruce forest. Plots treated with a single application of WA (8 t ha21) were compared with untreated control plots. At ﬁve sampling times (1, 4, 15, 62 and 460 d) after the addition of WA, various soil microbiological variables such as microbial biomass C (Cmic), basal respiration (soil native CO2 release), in situ soil respiration (CO2 efﬂux at the soil surface), as well as enzyme activities (acid and alkaline phosphatase, urease, and protease) were determined. Soil chemical properties measured included pH, organic C and total N, and exchangeable cations. WA amendment resulted in a rapid change in the rate of CO2 evolution and Cmic. It appeared that an increase in microbial activity in soil treated with WA was accompanied by an increase in the growth rate of soil microorganisms. At sampling dates 4 and 15 d after WA application, Cmic and CO2 evolution rates increased by factors of 1.6 and 1.9, respectively. After 460 d, differences in the CO2 evolution and Cmic in the control and WA treated plots were still evident. A similar effect could also be shown in situ with higher CO2 efﬂux from the soil surface in the WA treated plots. Higher biomass and bioactivity was related to the increases in the pH and in the quantity of nutrients after the WA had been added to the soil. The higher activity was linked to increased mineralization of organic matter, which was followed by decreases in the soil total C and N contents in the ﬁrst day after treatment. The enzyme activities responded only weakly to the WA treatment. The higher supply of inorganic P from WA led to a small depression in phosphatase activity. In contrast, the enzyme activities of the N-cycle were stimulated by the addition of WA, which had a low N content. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were carried out to characterize and examine wood ash from a biomass-fueled commercial power plant as a lime. Experimental treatments include wood ash and two commercial limes applied at six application rates. The effective calcium carbonate equivalence (ECCE) of wood ash ranged from 22 to 49%. Wood ash increased soil pH by 0.31–3.18 over unlimed soils, and these changes in pH were similar to the effect of commercial limes. The soil pH at three weeks after wood ash application was constant through week seventeen. Wood ash increased electrical conductivity by 0.13–0.63 dS m−1 compared to unlimed soils at three weeks after liming; however, a 39–69% decreased was observed by week seventeen. Common bermudagrass did not respond to the application of wood ash and commercial limes. The results of this study suggest that wood ash from the biomass-fueled commercial power plant with low ECCE could be a liming material.",

		"abstract": "The present review aims to summarize current knowledge in the topic of wood ash application to boreal forest and aquatic ecosystems, and the different effects derived from these actions. Much research has been conducted regarding the effects of wood ash application on forest growth. Present studies show that, generally speaking, forest growth can be increased on wood ash–ameliorated peatland rich in nitrogen. On mineral soils, however, no change or even decreased growth have been reported. The effects on ground vegetation are not very clear, as well as the effects on fungi, soil microbes, and soildecomposing animals. The discrepancies between different studies are for the most part explained by abiotic factors such as variation in fertility among sites, different degrees of stabilization, and wood ash dosage used, and different time scales among different studies. The lack of knowledge in the field of aquatic ecosystems and their response to ash application is an important issue for future research. The few studies conducted have mainly considered changes in water chemistry. The biotoxic effects of ash application can roughly be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Among the primary effects is toxicity deriving from compounds in the wood ash and cadmium is probably the worst among these. The secondary effects of wood ash are generally due to its alkaline capacity and a release of ions into the soil and soil water, and finally, watercourses and lakes. Given current knowledge, we would recommend site- and wood ash–specific application practices, rather than broad and general guidelines for wood ash application to forests.",

The results show no indication of biotoxic effects due to wood ash (adjusted to neutral) treatments. However, when no adjustments of pH in wood ash solutions were made, inhibitory effects on motile factors and cell growth were observed at higher concentrations of wood ash (10–25 g L−1) due to high pH (>8). In tests with pH adjusted to neutral, enhanced motility was observed. These results indicate that high concentration of WAA could affect freshwater environments.",

Studies on the effects of wood ash on aquatic organisms and ecosystems are, however, few. This study investigated the effects of wood ash (0.1–10 g l− 1) on the freshwater moss Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw., which has previously been shown to be a sensitive test organism for assessing environmental pollution. After nine weeks of treatment with wood ash, a significant effect of enhanced stem growth was observed at higher concentrations (1–10 g l− 1). The concentration of wood ash was also correlated with the growth of secondary branches. Photosynthesis (oxygen evolution after 4 h of exposure to wood ash) was significantly lower in the alkaline treatments (no pH adjustment) compared to the treatments with neutral wood ash solutions (pH adjusted to 7.5). Furthermore, photosynthesis in the alkaline wood ash treatments was significantly lower compared to the control. The ratio between the optical density value before and after acidification (OD665/665a) was higher for all wood ash concentrations compared to the control. The OD665/665a values ranged from 1.52 to 1.61 and there was a difference, however not significant, between the alkaline and the neutral treatment at 10 g l− 1 wood ash. This study clearly demonstrated that wood ash may be beneficial for F. antipyretica at moderate concentrations (0.5–5 g l−1), particularly when a sudden increase in pH is avoided.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden, whole tree harvest is common practice, possibly leading to the depletion of mineral nutrients. Furthermore, the increased use of forestry residues for heat production has caused an increasingly growing amount of by-product consisting of wood ash. Therefore, the Swedish Forest Agency has recommended wood ash application (WAA) to replace the mineral nutrients removed by whole tree harvesting, as well as a means to mitigate the acidiﬁcation of boreal forests and surface waters. In a multidisciplinary study during 2003–2006 in Bispga˚rden (Sweden), we have investigated the limnological effects on a ﬁrst order stream after WAA (conducted in 2004; 3000 kg haÀ1) to a 50-ha forested catchment. In general, no signiﬁcant effects on an annual basis were found for acidiﬁcation parameters, such as pH, alkalinity and toxic forms of aluminum (Al). There was, however, evidence of an increased pH during the spring ﬂood, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the frequency of low pHvalues (<5.6). Moreover, alkalinity increased in the years 2005 and 2006 compared to that of 2003, although the increase in 2006 was not statistically different from that in 2005 or 2003. High concentrations of Al repeatedly occurred in the stream, and the WAA did not affect the frequencies of high concentrations of toxic Al forms (>50 mg lÀ1). The benthic diatom community did not change as a result of the wood ash treatment and the diatom-based index IPS (Indice de PulluoSensibilite´) indicated no nutrient enrichment or organic pollution of the stream water. There were, however, indices of elevated concentrations of potassium (K) in the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica and in leaves from Alder (Alnus incana). We conclude that wood ash treatment of a forested catchment with the dose and form of ash applied in this study did not modify the freshwater ecosystem of a ﬁrst order stream.",

		"abstract": "Nutrient concentrations in current and 1-year-old needles were analyzed annually for 5 years after application of hardened wood ash in 1–4-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands within a range of climate and fertility gradients. At each site, 3000 kg ha−1 hardened wood ash of two types, Nymölla and Perstorp, was applied in a randomized block design. Wood ash Nymölla contained 12 kg ha−1 P, 30 kg ha−1 K, 891 kg ha−1 Ca, 72 kg ha−1 Mg and wood ash Perstorp contained 12 kg ha−1 P, 60 kg ha−1 K, 486 kg ha−1 Ca, and 60 kg ha−1 Mg. The ash was intended to compensate for nutrients removed at the preceding harvest when logging residues were collected and removed from the site (whole-tree harvesting). The climate gradient included four climate zones throughout Sweden and each of these included a fertility gradient of three sites classiﬁed according to their ground vegetation type. There were no effects on nutrient concentrations in the needles 1 year after the application of wood ash. Five years after ash application, the concentrations of P, K and Ca in current and 1-year-old needles were higher than in the control plots. The results were consistent over all stands, irrespective of climate zone and fertility status. P and K concentrations were higher in spruce needles from plots treated with Perstorp wood ash, whereas Ca concentrations were higher in those of Nymölla treated plots. Analyses across all study sites revealed a treatment effect in terms of increased ratios of P:N, K:N and Ca:N in 1-year-old needles. The ratio P:N tended to increase with time in the Perstorp wood ash treatment compared with the control. The needle concentrations of Mg and S were not affected by the ash applications. The increase in needle nutrient concentrations after application of hardened wood ash suggests that wood ash recycling could be used in order to replace nutrients removed at whole-tree harvesting.",

The pH had been changed by addition of lime and wood-ash from 4.34.4 to 7.0 in one soil and from 3.94.4 to 6.1 in the other. Higher total microbial activities and higher bacterial growth rates, measured as soil respiration rate and thymidine incorporation rate, respectively, were found in the treatments with increased pH. Similar effects of soil pH on the thymidine incorporation rate were found using two different methods, by measuring rates in either a soil slurry with all bacteria present or using a subsample of bacteria extracted from soil after homogenization-centrifugation. The number of culturable bacteria was up to 5.1 times higher in the high pH soils, while the acridine orange direct counts were unaffected by the treatments. Thus, the proportions of culturable bacteria increased in the limed and ash-treated soils compared to the untreated controls. An altered bacterial community composition due to liming was indicated by an altered response to pH, where the pH of the soil was correlated to the optimum pH for growth of the bacterial community. The ATP content of the soil was unaffected or increased in treatments with high pH compared to the control, while microbial biomass estimated by the substrate induced respiration technique (SIR) was always higher in limed and ash-treated plots.",

		"abstract": "There is a great need to increase the production in Swedish forests to meet future demand from the forest industry and the bio-energy sector. One option to increase the production is to supply nutrients to young stands of Norway spruce. For the practical application it is important to develop and optimise fertilisation regimes in terms of production, economy and leaching of nutrients. The frequency of fertilisation is one important variable in the fertilisation regime, and this study aimed to study effects of different fertilisation frequencies on production and leaching of nitrogen. In 2001, ﬁve ﬁeld experiments were established in southern, central and northern Sweden. Young stands of Norway spruce were fertilised every year, every second year and every third year. In addition, fertilisation with sludge pellets and wood-ash combined with nitrogen was investigated. The current annual increment after ﬁve years of treatment was signiﬁcantly larger in fertilised than in unfertilised treatments. The difference in production between fertilisation every year and every second year was insigniﬁcant, while fertilisation every third year resulted in lower production. Sludge pellets and wood-ash fertilisation gave signiﬁcantly lower production than fertilisation every second year even though approximately the same amount of nitrogen was applied. There was relatively little leaching of nitrate to ground water in all treatments; 0.6–1 kg N ha–1 a–1 from plots with fertilisation every year or every second year; and 2.7 kg N ha–1 a–1 from plots with fertilisation every third year. Most of the leaching was after the ﬁrst fertilisation, in all treatments at all sites.",

		"abstract": "Additions of fire residues in the form of charcoal and wood ash may better emulate natural disturbance processes in managed boreal forests. We examined the effects of a poplar (Populus) wood biochar and a high-carbon wood ash on soil and vegetation in a 3-year experiment in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Both soil amendments increased soil pH and soil Ca levels; high-carbon wood ash also increased soil Cu, Zn, B, S, and Pb. Amendments had large effects on plant community composition, favoring a subset of ruderal species including raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) and goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.). The addition of high-carbon wood ash resulted in declines in growth of planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss); a path analysis suggests that this was due to the effects of toxic elements rather than the indirect effects of competition. We conclude that high-carbon wood ash, while qualifying as a type of biochar and having some beneficial effects on soil properties, can enhance toxic metals in boreal forest soils, with negative consequences to early tree growth. Differences in plant species responses to biochars and the potential for toxicity effects and indirect effects mediated by plant competition will require screening and field trials of potential biochars prior to their use in operational forestry and forest restoration.",

		"abstract": "The effects of wood ash application on soil microbial processes were investigated in three drained forested peatlands, which differed in nutrient status and time since application. Measured variables included the concentrations of soil elements and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation enzyme activity, potential methane (CH4) oxidation, CH4 production and microbial respiration kinetics. Wood ash application had a considerable inﬂuence on soil element concentrations. This mirrored a decrease in the majority of the microbial biomarkers by more than one-third in the two oligotrophic peatlands, although the microbial community composition was not altered. The decreases in PLFAs coincided with reduced net ammoniﬁcation and net N mineralization. Other measured variables did not change systematically as a result of wood ash application. No signiﬁcant changes in microbial biomass or processes were found in the mesotrophic peatland, possibly because too little time (1 year) had elapsed since the wood ash application. This study suggests that oligotrophic peatlands can be substantially affected by wood ash for a period of at least 4 years after application. However, within 25 years of the wood ash application, the microbial biomass seemed to have recovered or adapted to enhanced element concentrations in the soil.",

The objective of this study was to determine the relevant chemical and physical properties of selected mixtures of aspen burner-ash, log-yard waste scrapings (sandy soil plus wood waste) and a sandy soil as an intermediate landﬁll cover. The treatment mixtures, per weight basis, included: (1) 100% sand; (2) 80/20 log-yard waste/ash; (3) 50/50 sand/ash; (4) 40/30/30 sand/log-yard waste/ash; (5) 60/40 ash/log-yard waste; (6) 100% ash; (7) 100% log-yard waste. All treatments containing ash had a very high pH (12.8–13.3) and electrical conductivity (39–105 dS m−1). The ash contained signiﬁcant amounts of beneﬁcial nutrients, but soil solution dominance by sodium carbonate suppressed concentrations of calcium and magnesium. Treatments containing ash showed lower bulk densities but relatively higher soil strength values (2.5–3.5 kg cm−2) than that for the log-yard waste scrapings or the sandy soil, due to its self-cementing properties. Mixtures of soil material and ash had lower hydraulic conductivity rates (∼1.0 × 10−4 cm s−1) and lower inﬁltration rates compared to the sandy soil (∼5 × 10−3 cm s−1) or log-yard waste scrapings or pure ash. Water holding capacity increased with treatments containing ash. A soil–water balance model used to determine percolation rates through a 60 cm layer of treatment material showed that treatments containing a mixture of ash and soil material decreased the downward ﬂow of water throughout the year.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, the environmental impact of logging residue recovery (LRR) and nutrient compensation (NC) in Sweden is analysed and evaluated economically. Logging residue recovery and recirculation of wood ash can generate local environmental beneÿts, such as reduced soil acidiÿcation and, primarily in southern Sweden, also improved nitrogen balance and reduced nutrient leaching from forest land. Recovery of residues leads to a slight increase in net emissions of carbon dioxide, compared with on site decomposition, but this increase is small compared with the net emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel cycles. The impact of toxic compounds is estimated to be insigniÿcant, as is that on biodiversity, when current guidelines for forestry management methods are followed. The total cost, including direct costs and environmental costs=beneÿts, of LRR and NC is estimated to be about 1.1, 3.3 and 4.6 US$=GJ in southern, central and northern Sweden, respectively. For comparison, the current direct cost of LRR, excluding NC, is, on average, about 4:0 US$=GJ in Sweden. Almost one-third of the Swedish forest fuel potential is estimated to be located in the south, but this potential varies from about 50 to over 100 PJ per year depending on the assumptions made. Thus, when local environmental beneÿts are also considered, the overall economic beneÿt derived from the utilisation of forest fuels could increase signiÿcantly in southern Sweden, where large quantities of logging residues are available. c 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Wood ashes can also be regarded as a measure against soil acidification. Wood ashes were applied at various rates to the soil in a 35 years old pine (Pinus sylvestris, L) stand at Ringam~a in Blekinge, South Sweden. The experiments started in 1984. The different treatments gave a clear effect on soil chemistry with decreased acidity and aluminum ion concentrations. The base saturation increased in both mor and upper mineral soil layers. Generally no significant increases were found in soil concentrations of heavy metals, except for Cu which increased significantly in the mor layer. Also the extractable Mn concentration increased, in spite of the increased pH in the soil after application of ashes. In order to achieve a biological circulation of nutrients through ash application without polluting the environment, it is of ultimate importance that the wood chips used in power plants and other furnaces have a low concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash was applied to a forest ecosystem with the aim to recycle nutrients taken from the forest and to mitigate the negative effects of intensive harvesting. After two years, the application of 8,000 kg ha−1 of wood ash increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg. Similarly, an increase in Ca and Mg in the Norway spruce ﬁne roots was recorded, leading to signiﬁcant linear correlations between soil and root Ca and soil and root Mg. In contrast to these macronutrients, the micronutrients Fe and Zn and the toxic element Al decreased in the soil exchangeable fraction with the addition of wood ash, but not in the ﬁne roots. Only Mn decreased in soil and in ﬁne roots leading to a signiﬁcant linear correlation between soil and root Mn. In soil, as well as in ﬁne roots, strong positive correlations were found between the elements Ca and Mg and between Fe and Al. This indicates that the uptake of Mg resembles that of Ca and that of Al that of Fe. With the wood ash application, the pH increased from 3.2 to 4.8, the base saturation from 30% to 86%, the molar basic cations/Al ratio (BC/Al) of the soil solution from 1.5 to 5.5, and the molar Ca/Al ratio of the ﬁne roots from 1.3 to 3.7. Overall, all below-ground indicators of soil acidiﬁcation responded positively to the wood ash application within two years. Nitrate concentrations increased only slightly in the soil solution at a soil depth of 75–80 cm, and no signs of increased heavy metal concentrations in the soils or in the ﬁne roots were apparent. This suggests that the recycling of wood ash could be an integral part of sustainable forest management because it closes the nutrient cycle and reverses soil acidiﬁcation.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of wood ash application on concentrations, storage, and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a Swiss forest soil. In May 1998, we added 8 Mg wood ash haϪ1 to a forest soil. We determined 20 PAHs and 14 PCBs in the organic layer, in the bulk mineral soil, and in soil material taken from preferential flow paths and from the matrix before and after the wood ash application. In the control plots, the concentrations of PAHs in the organic layer indicated moderate pollution (sum of 20 PAHs: 0.8–1.6 mg kgϪ1 ), but sum of PCB concentrations was high (21–48 ␮g kgϪ1 ). The wood ash had high concentrations of PAHs (sum of 20 PAHs: 16.8 mg kgϪ1 ), but low concentrations of PCBs (sum of 14 PCBs: 3.4 ␮g kgϪ1 ). The wood ash application increased the PAH concentrations in the organic horizons up to sixfold. In contrast, PCB concentrations did not change in the Oa horizon and decreased up to one third in the Oi and Oe horizons. The decrease was probably caused by the mobilization of stored PCBs because of the high pH of the wood ash. This probably results in a higher mobility of dissolved organic matter, acting as PCB carrier. In the mineral soil, the preferential flow paths of the A horizon contained more PAHs and PCBs (ϩ20 Ϯ 15% and ϩ43 Ϯ 60%, respectively) than the matrix. This was particularly true for higher molecular weight compounds (molecular weight Ͼ 200 g molϪ1 ). Below 50 cm depth, concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were smaller in the preferential flow paths, suggesting that in deeper depths, processes acting as sinks dominated over inputs in the preferential flow paths.",

		"abstract": "Preferential ¯ow of water in soils is a common phenomenon. Our objective was to investigate whether preferential ¯ow paths have higher microbial biomass and different microbial community structures than the rest of the soil. We stained the preferential ¯ow paths in a forest soil with a food dye and sampled soil material from preferential ¯ow paths and from the soil matrix at four depths down to 1 m. Distinct differences in physico±chemical properties between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix existed and, thus, different environmental living conditions for microorganisms. The experimental addition of wood ash increased pH and base saturation in the preferential ¯ow paths to a higher extent than in the soil matrix, highlighting the importance of preferential ¯ow paths for solute input into the mineral soil. The organic C concentrations were approximately 10±70% higher in the preferential ¯ow paths than in the matrix. The organic N concentrations were also enriched in the preferential ¯ow paths, as well as the effective cation exchange capacity and the base saturation. Microbial biomass determined with the fumigation-extraction method was 9±92% higher in the preferential ¯ow paths than in the soil matrix, probably due to the better nutrient and substrate supply. The DNA concentrations and direct cell counts showed a similar pattern, while domain-speci®c genetic ®ngerprints based on small subunit ribosomal RNA genes did not re¯ect the differences between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix. Eukarya and Archaea only showed a depth-dependence and Bacteria showed no changes with ¯ow region or with depths. However, Pseudomonas displayed different community structures between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix. This indicated that possibly only few communities with a broad acceptance for substrates and aerobic as well as anaerobic growth speci®cally pro®t from the favourable conditions in the preferential ¯ow paths. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

		"abstract": "As a consequence of heterogeneous transport in soils, only a small part of the soil might be responsible for sorbing incoming elements. After staining preferential ¯ow paths in forested Dystric Cambisol with a colour dye, we sampled soil material from the ¯ow paths and from the soil matrix. We measured chemical properties and sorption isotherms of these two ¯ow regions and estimated the signi®cance of preferential ¯ow paths for the transport of solutes leached from wood ash applied at the surface. In the A horizon (0±9 cm depth), the cation exchange capacity of the ¯ow paths was 83.8 mmolc kg±1, while that of the soil matrix was only 74.6 mmolc kg±1. The base saturation was 42% and soil organic matter content was 41% larger in ¯ow paths than in the soil matrix. The sorption capacity for Cu was also larger than in the matrix, whereas the sorption capacity for Sr was similar in both ¯ow regions. The impact of the addition of 8 t wood ash ha±1 on soil chemical properties was restricted mainly to the ¯ow paths in the uppermost 20 cm of the soil; it was negligible in the matrix and at greater depths. Concentrations of exchangeable Ca in the ¯ow paths increased nearly 10-fold during the 6 months following the addition of the wood ash, and those of organically bound Pb by 50%. The opposite effect was found for exchangeable Al. Our results show that only part of the whole soil volume, approximately 50% of 0±20 cm in our study, is involved in transporting and sorbing the elements applied with the wood ash or as tracers. Such differences must be considered when calculating the maximal impact of any addition of fertilizer, wood ash, or liming agent.",

		"abstract": "Application of wood ash on forest and agricultural soils can provide nutrients and increase soil pH, however, it changes the soil chemistry rapidly and temporarily, often resulting in reduced plant growth and potassium leaching. Biochar from woody materials are nutrient poor and need nutrient enhancement prior to soil application. In this study, spruce residues were mixed with spruce/pine ash in different ratios (0e50%) to produce biochar-ash composites at 450  C. The biochar yield (ash-free basis) increased by 80e90% with the addition of 50% ash due to catalytic biochar formation. Consequently, nearly half the amount of wood is needed to produce the same amount of (ash-free) biochar. Mineral release was moderated in the composites compared to pure ash, demonstrated by a lower electric conductivity and % available K content (a factor of 2.5e4.4 lower than in wood ash). Furthermore, the % available chromium content, which is a key potentially toxic element in wood ash, decreased by a factor of 50e160. Soil application of biochar-ash composites decreases the risk of Cr toxicity, salinity stress and leaching of K in soil substantially compared to ash application. Biochar-ash composites are a novel product with vast unexplored potential for use in forestry and agriculture.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash recycling to forests may counteract nutrient losses caused by biomass harvest, since most nutrients except nitrogen are largely retained in the ash. Raw wood ash has an alkaline reaction with water and contains easily soluble as well as resistant compounds. Ash can be treated to ease handling and to avoid undesired effects on vegetation and leaching of nutrients. Forest ecosystems with different tree species and soils provide variable conditions for mineral dissolution with respect to pH, amount of organic ligands and humidity in the forest ﬂoor and the top soil. To study the effects of tree species and soil type on wood ash dissolution, granulated wood ash with particle size 2–4 mm was incubated in situ for 7 years in polyamide mesh bags. The bags were placed under the organic horizon of beech, oak, Norway spruce and Douglas-ﬁr on a nutrient poor soil (typic Haplorthod ) and a nutrient-rich soil (oxyaquic Hapludalf ) in Denmark. After 7 years of incubation, the weight loss of the wood ash granulates was 20% in both soil types. Nutrient losses determined by total element analysis were about 35% for calcium, magnesium and potassium and 19% for phosphorus, regardless of tree species or soil type. Incubation for 7 years could not demonstrate possible effects of tree species and soil type on the dissolution of granulated wood ash incubated in mesh bags. The missing effect of tree species and soil type is suggested to be an effect of the incubation method and the pre-treatment of the ash tested here using cement as a binder. Across this broad range in chemical weathering environment the granulated wood ash dissolved at a rather slow rate, suggesting that this ash will have a negligible impact on the soil environment.",

		"abstract": "Rehabilitation of skid trails, temporary roads, and log landings is required for many harvested sites in British Columbia; however, more information is needed regarding practical methods to return these access areas to productive forest. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) seedlings (1 + 0) were planted into (i) fully rehabilitated landings (burn-pile debris and topsoil incorporated), (ii) tilled landings, and (iii) unprepared portions of the adjacent cutblock. After two seasons of growth in the field, seedlings planted on fully rehabilitated landings were 38% larger, more robust, and exhibited 44% greater absolute growth and 22% greater relative growth rates, than seedlings planted in the adjacent cutblock. Seedlings planted on tilled landings were 33% smaller, and exhibited absolute growth rates 38% less, and relative growth rates 18% less, than seedlings planted in the adjacent cutblock. Seedlings planted in the cutblock exhibited higher ectomycorrhizal colonization rates. Our results indicate that tillage alone was not sufficient to fully rehabilitate these landings, but that incorporation of recovered topsoil and burn-pile debris produced an excellent growth substrate. This method, using materials found on site, can prevent a significant loss of land regenerating to productive second-growth forest. Re´sume´ : En Colombie-Britannique, les sentiers de de´bardage, les chemins temporaires et les jete´es doivent eˆtre re´habilite´s dans plusieurs stations apre`s une coupe.

Our hypothesis is that different wood ashes and different proportions of them could have beneficial or detrimental effects depending on the applied dose. Materials and methods Dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption were used to evaluate the potential improvement of soil conditions through the application of two different wood ashes coming from industrial waste. Different ash proportions and time dependence have been used to make comparisons. The respiration curves obtained through a closed-jar incubation experiment were well fitted by a sigmoidal function, the derivative of which yields the time evolution of the consumption rate.\nResults and discussion The results indicate that the dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption are very sensitive to the presence of ashes in the soil, and the reached values of both are linked to the applied dose of them. In our research, soil oxygen consumption is time and rate dependent of ash application. The curves show that parameter was affected by the ashes in different way, raising the respiration rate, and stretching the biological activity period.\nConclusions Dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption are very sensitive to the presence of ashes and can",

		"abstract": "Land application is a cost-effective way of disposing of wood ash. However, high volume wood ash application tends to increase soil pH, solubilizing soil organic matter (SOM), and enhancing metal mobility. Column studies (1.5 Â 20 cm) were conducted to determine the leachability of Cu and Ni in an ash-amended soil. In the first study, deionized water was used to leach three columns: ash, ash mixed with topsoil, and ash mixed with topsoil overlying a spodic horizon. In the second study, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and a mixture of humic and fulvic acids (HAFA) were used to leach ash columns. Leaching was conducted, one pore volume (PV) at a time, under unsaturated conditions. Leachate concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Cl, Cu, and Ni, as well as pH were determined. Leachate pH ranged from f 10 to f 11 in the water- and acid-leached columns, respectively. In the ash-only columns, Cu leaching was in the form of soluble complexes with Cl. When wood ash was mixed with soil, Cu leached as soluble complexes with DOC at high pH ( f 10). Columns with a Bh horizon had 30% less leaching of Cu, possibly due to increased metal retention. Nickel leachability was not affected to the same extent as Cu. Organic acid-leached ash columns showed lower DOC, Cu, and Ni leaching, suggesting that these two metals and DOC were precipitating out with DOC at the high ionic strengths of these solutions ( > 0.3 mol dm À 3). Precipitation was greater in the more reactive FA-leached columns. This study shows the need to understand the system to which wood ash is applied to minimize potential harmful effects.

Treatments were compared for influence on soil pH, capacity to supply mineral nutrients to spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.

However, in admixtures of the two, plant dry weight increased with increasing rate of wood ash addition. Wood ash containing amendments had a greater positive effect on soil pH than did lime only treatments. Wood ash treatments increased soil EC, while lime only treatments had no effect. Losses of mineral elements decreased with successive leachings for treated and control soils. Calcium, K, and Na were leached from the soil in greater amounts from wood-ash treated soil. Leached Mg, however, was attributed to the soil and not to the amendment.

The relation between needle P concentration and acid phosphatase activity in the humus layer was studied during 1990-93 in a Norway spruce stand where the water and N and P supplies had been experimentally manipulated since 1988. Treatments included control (C), yearly application of ammonium sulphate (NS), N-free fertilizer (V), granulated wood ash (A), irrigation (I), drought (D) and water plus nutrients in an \"optimum\" combination (IF). We found indications of a feed-back mechanism for P, where low concentrations in the needles were associated with increased acid phosphatase activity in the humus layer. Acid phosphatase estimations made during moist soil conditions were much more informative than those made during dry conditions. We further argue that a site-specific \"base-line\" exists for acid phosphatase activity in the soil, mainly originating from enzymes immobilized in the field, but active in the assay. Increased phosphatase activity, above the base line, was generally found in the A, I and NS treatments, but in some cases also in C. Although P and N concentrations were significantly higher in the IF treatment as compared to the C and the D treatments, the P as fraction of N was 0.10 and thus balanced in all cases. In the A and I treatment P:N was around 0.09, while it was only 0.07 in the NS treatment, mainly due to high N concentrations. The latter treatment thus created an imbalanced situation where P additions most likely would have increased tree growth.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash application on ECM fungal mycelial production, capacity to retain N, diversity and community composition. In-growth mesh bags were installed in control and treated plots. After 6 months, 15N labeled ammonium and nitrate were applied into the mesh bags, and 24 h later extramatrical mycelium (EMM) was extracted and analyzed. Wood ash had no effects on EMM in-growth, N retention capacity, diversity or community composition. In contrast, there were signiﬁcant seasonal differences in the amount of EMM produced. These results demonstrate that applying up to 6 t haÀ1 of wood ash in this type of plantation forest is a safe management practice that does not increase N leaching or negatively affect ECM fungi.",

Over a few decades a number of studies have been carried out on the utilization of wood ashes in agriculture and forestry as an alternative method for disposal. Because of their properties and their in¯uence on soil chemistry the utilization of wood ashes is particularly suited for the fertility management of tropical acid soils and forest soils. This review principally focuses on ash from the wood industry and power plants and considers its physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics, its eect on soil properties, on the availability of nutrient elements and on the growth and chemical composition of crops and trees, as well as its impact on the environment.

		"abstract": "Burning biomass fuels generates large quantities of ash products which contain plant nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, P and K. To return these nutrients back to forest soil, biomass ash could be spread onto forest soil. Although biomass ash land application can decrease soil acidity and restore soil nutrient balance, its high alkalinity presents some challenges in terms of direct land application. The high alkalinity affects the leachability of various ash components and adversely affects ground vegetation. In this paper, we will show how CO2 can be used to effectively decrease ash alkalinity. The use of CO2 aqueous solubility and bicarbonate reactivity will be shown to be essential. From the study, we found that the rate of CO2 absorption depends heavily on the moisture content of the ash. Thus, the amount of water that needs to be added to the cooled ash products is important. The rate is also inﬂuenced by the CO2 partial pressure in the gas, up to almost 15% by volume. This concentration of CO2 is commonly found in treated ﬂue gas providing an opportunity for CO2 capture. The work also reports on the effect of carbonation on the leachability of ash nutrients.",

Given the potential for utilization, or issues with disposal, facile methods are needed for determining the compositions of the ﬂy ashes from recently-available gasiﬁer-based bioenergy systems. Proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were used to characterize the ﬂy ash recovered from a pilot-scale (25 kW) modular bioenergy system operated with wood chips as the feedstock. The composition of the ﬂy ash from the downdraft gasiﬁer showed some similarities to compositions reported for boiler wood ashes, apart from one half of the material being unburned carbon. Although ICP-AES showed greater sensitivity for the analysis of the ﬂy ash, especially for small amounts of heavy metal contaminants, PIXE proved to be a powerful analytical tool for screening of elements from sodium to uranium. Such broad spectrum screenings could prevent the inadvertent land application of unsuspected pollutant elements. Fly ashes from biomass gasiﬁcation appear to be suitable for use as ash-based fertilizers for forest lands; however, combustion to remove unburned carbon may be advisable.",

In this study, total and leachable concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in four ash samples and one green liquor sludge. The ash sample with the highest carbon content also contained high levels of PAHs; three of the ash samples had total concentrations exceeding the limit permitted by the Swedish Forest Agency for recycling to forest soils. The leachable concentrations were higher for the nonstabilized samples; this was probably due to colloid-facilitated transport of the contaminants in these samples. However, the leachable concentrations were overall relatively low in all the samples studied. The amounts of PAHs introduced to forest soils by additions of stabilized, recyclable ash products will be determined primarily by the rate of weathering of the ash particles and the total concentration of contaminants.",

The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest ﬂoor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007–1 October 2008. No signiﬁcant (p N 0.05) changes in forest ﬂoor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha−1, while the CH4 ﬂuxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha−1. The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0–0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p b 0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p b 0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the ﬁrst 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was signiﬁcantly larger (p b 0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m2 ha− 1 year− 1 and 0.52 m2 ha− 1 year− 1, respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not signiﬁcantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p b 0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.",

In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources – both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon “breakeven time” and lifetime net CO\n              2\n              removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO\n              2\n              removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options,\n              e.g.\n              , natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.",

		"abstract": "Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil and vegetation nutrient concentrations were measured in pole-sized northern hardwood and aspen forests to quantify the potential for various nutrient amendments to increase tree growth, as well as potential deleterious effects on vegetation. Four blocks were installed in each forest type containing the following treatments: control, N  Ca  Mg  K  P  S (complete), wood-®red boiler ash (ash), N  wood-®red boiler ash N  ash, and two rates of paper mill sludge (sludge and 2Â sludge). The northern hardwood forests had three additional treatments: N, Ca  Mg  K (base cations), and N  Ca  Mg  K (N  base cations). Fertilizer treatments were designed to provide N at a rate of 100 kg haÀ1. Other nutrients were applied in proportion to N so that N, P, K, S, Mg, and Ca were applied at a ratio of 100:50:33:9:5:4, respectively. Total ANPP was not signi®cantly different among treatments for the maple stands, but plots treated with wood ash were 10% greater than controls. ANPP was greater in 1998 and 1999 for aspen plots receiving N  ash, but results were only statistically signi®cant p  0:013 in 1999. Basal area differed by 40±60% among experimental plots within any given block and was positively correlated to wood increment. Wood increment, adjusted for basal area, did not differ signi®cantly among treatments for the aspen stands, but the N  ash treatment was 30% greater than the control. A two-way factorial comparison indicated that ash had a signi®cant p  0:024 positive effect on wood increment and N had a signi®cant p  0:044 negative effect on wood increment for the maple stands. Tree growth was not correlated to foliar nutrient concentrations, but ratios of K to other elements (K:Ca, K:Mg, K:N, and K:P) were highest, on average, for wood ash plots. These differences were not statistically signi®cant with the exception of K:N for the aspen stands and K:Ca for the maple stands. We did not observe any bene®cial effects of paper mill sludge on forest growth, but there was some evidence that wood ash increased annual wood production.",

		"abstract": "Urea used to fertilize acid forest soils can be lost by NH3 volatilization. The objective of this research was to examine, in the laboratory, the impact of CaCl2, applied with urea, on NH, losses from (i) forest floor litter (FFL) alone, (ii) FFL with CaCO3, and (iii) wood ash (WA) amended FFL. Ammonia loss, urease activity, and N availability were measured as functions of the CaCl2 treatments. Low NH3 loss occurred during the first 10 d after application of urea; however, NH3 loss increased in the 10 d after a second urea application. Application of CaCO3 or WA to the FFL prior to urea fertilization caused slightly faster NH3 losses than observed from FFL alone. Reuse of FFL with CaCO3 (after extensive leaching) also resulted in very rapid NH3 loss. When CaCl2 was added with urea, however, at a molar ratio of 0.5 or 1.0, there were negligible NH3 losses from either unamended FFL or FFL with CaCO3. Low urease activity was detected in unamended FFL after urea application (16 °C). Higher urease activity was measured in FFL after treatment with a 0.25 molar ratio of CaCl2/urea (1:4 Ca/urea), but NH, losses in the presence of CaQ2 were extremely low or nondetectable. Urease activity in all WA treatments was high. Based on the amount of KC1extractable N (NH4, urea) and volatilized NH3, it appeared that N was rapidly immobilized at 0.5 and 1.0 Ca/urea in both unamended FFL and FFL amended with CaCO3. Recovery of nrea-N was complete in all of the WA treatments and in the urea and 0.25 molar ratio of CaCl2 + urea in FFL and FFL + CaCO3. Extractable N and volatile NH3 from the 0.5 and 1.0 soluble Ca/urea treatments (FFL and FFL with CaCO3) accounted for less than one-half of the N applied. It was hypothesized that CaCl2 at molar ratios > 0.5 with respect to urea stimulated biological immobilization of NH4.",

The volume of the growing stock was more than 70 m 3 ha -1 for the highest dose while control plots produced less than 15 m3ha -l. Vegetation characteristics changed following ash treatments with high ash doses favouring grasses and low ash doses promoting mosses. Some major changes in soil and foliar nutrient concentrations were evident due to ash fertilization. K and B, however, were clearly the most limiting nutrients that could be cycled where high doses of ash were used. This was particularly the case with a dose of 20 Mg ha -1. Decomposition of the topsoil was at its highest on plots with ash doses of 5 and 10 Mg h a - 1 ash and at its lowest when the dose was 2 Mg ha ~. This was partly due to differences in the C/N ratio of the soil. All decomposition parameters indicated a high degree of humification in the topsoil. High N content (of organic material), low C/N in the soil and optimum levels of foliar N concentrations suggested sufficient N mineralization for tree growth to have occurred in the soil.",

Therefore, in this study we evaluated the effects of pelletized ashes on the chemical and microbiological properties of four soils representative for the central Alps [rendzic Leptosol (L), ﬁbric Histosol (H), haplic Podzol (P), and dystric Cambisol (Cm)] in a microcosm trial during 22 weeks.

		"abstract": "Water quality of the Big Thompson River in the Front Range of Colorado was studied for 2 years following a high-elevation wildﬁre that started in October 2012 and burned 15% of the watershed. A combination of ﬁxed-interval sampling and continuous water-quality monitors was used to examine the timing and magnitude of water-quality changes caused by the wildﬁre. Preﬁre water quality was well characterized because the site has been monitored at least monthly since the early 2000s. Major ions and nitrate showed the largest changes in concentrations; major ion increases were greatest in the ﬁrst postﬁre snowmelt period, but nitrate increases were greatest in the second snowmelt period. The delay in nitrate release until the second snowmelt season likely reﬂected a combination of factors including ﬁre timing, hydrologic regime, and rates of nitrogen transformations. Despite the small size of the ﬁre, annual yields of dissolved constituents from the watershed increased 20–52% in the ﬁrst 2 years following the ﬁre. Turbidity data from the continuous sensor indicated high-intensity summer rain storms had a much greater effect on sediment transport compared to snowmelt. High-frequency sensor data also revealed that weekly sampling missed the concentration peak during snowmelt and short-duration spikes during rain events, underscoring the challenge of characterizing postﬁre water-quality response with ﬁxed-interval sampling.

Physicochemical measurements (pH, organic matter content, extractable and total C content, NH~- and total N content, cation-exchange capacity, base saturation) showed similarity between the fire-treated plots and those treated with the lowest dose of wood ash (1000 kg ha-l). The ash application did not change the level of microbial biomass C or fungal ergosterol when compared to the control, being around 7500 and 350 gg g-1 organic matter for the biomass C and ergosterol, respectively9 The fire treatment lowered the values of both biomass measurements to about half that of the control values9 The fire treatment caused a sevenfold fall in the respiration rate of fieldmoist soil to 1.8 ~tl h - 1g - ~ organic matter compared to the values of the control or ash treatments. However, in the same soils adjusted to a water-holding capacity of 60%, the differences between the fire treatment and the control were diminished, and the ash-fertilized plots were characterized by a higher respiration rate compared to the control plots. The glucose-induced respiration reacted in the same way as the water-adjusted soil respiration. The metabolic quotient, qCO2, gradually increased from the control level with increasing applications of ash, reaching a maximum in the fire treatment. Nitrification was not observed in the treatment plots.",

		"abstract": "The use of wood ash in forestry has been questioned because the cadmium (Cd) concentration of ash, which varies between 1 and 20 mg kg31 ash, exceeds the level allowed for fertilizers (3 mg kg31) used in agriculture. To investigate the combined and separated effects of Cd and ash on the forest humus microflora, pumice or wood ash, spiked with a water-soluble (CdCl2) or -insoluble (CdO) form of Cd at three levels (0, 400 and 1000 mg kg31), were applied at a fertilization level of 5000 kg ha31 in a laboratory microcosm study. The trial consisted of 60 microcosms (five replications per treatment), which were incubated in darkness at +20³C and a constant relative air humidity of 60%. After two months the humus in the microcosms was sampled. Analyses of CO2 evolution to measure the overall microbial activity and of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern to measure microbial community structure were performed. The substrate-use patterns of Biolog EcoPlates were analyzed as a measure of bacterial functionality. Finally the bacterial 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of different concentrations of Cd and the number of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria on nutrient agar in the presence of 0, 5 and 20 mg Cd l31 agar were applied to measure Cd tolerance. The use of pumice (pH of humus under the pumice 4.0) did not induce any changes in the above variables compared to two untreated microcosms (humus pH 3.9). Pumice was therefore used to distribute the Cd evenly over the humus surface in order to estimate the possible effect of Cd without ash (pH of humus under the ash 7.0). The application of ash increased the microbial activity, changed the PLFA and substrate-use patterns and increased cfu compared to the humus under pumice. The form and level of Cd in the ash had no further effect on this result. In the humus under pumice the level, but not the form of Cd decreased the microbial activity and changed the PLFA pattern compared to the unspiked pumice. None of the treatments induced bacterial tolerance to Cd. Ash thus protected the humus microflora from the harmful effects of Cd. ß 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

		"abstract": "The effects of lime and wood-ash on the microbial community structure were evaluated by analyzing the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition of soils from two areas in the south of Sweden. A pine forest was amended with lime or ash at two concentrations, and a spice forest was limed at one concentration. The treatments were carried out S-6 years before sampling and raised the pH from approx. 4.0 to values between 4.8 and 7.0. At both sites there was a difference in the PLFA composition between the treated plots and the controls. The changes found were similar at both sites and correlated to the pH changes. No difference was found between limed plots and those treated with wood-ash. The methylbranched fatty acids i15:0, i16:O and lOMe16:0, the monounsaturated fatty acids 16: lo7t and 18: 1~9, the cyclopropane fatty acid cyl9:0, and the saturated fatty acid 20:0 were more abundant in the control plots. In the plots with the highest pH there was a three-fold increase in the fatty acid 16: 105. An increase was also found for the fatty acids i14:0, 16:lw9, 16: lw7c, cyl7:0, 18:107 and lOMe18:O.No effecton 18:2w6 was found. The changes in PLFA pattern indicated that the increased pH caused a shift in the bacterial community to more Gram-negative and fewer Gram-positive bacteria, while the amount of fungi was unaffected. The increase in lOMe18:0 in limed soils indicated an increase in actinomycetes.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, a screening-level life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is used to compare the potential environmental benefits and tradeoffs of different management options for wood ash, namely, agricultural land application, forest soil amendment, use in forest roads, use in concrete and mortar, and landfilling. Uncertainty analyses are used to evaluate the generalizability of the results obtained. Although decisions regarding the selection of a beneficial use option are site-specific and depend on available local markets and wood ash characteristics, this study shows that it is possible to draw a few general conclusions from the application of LCA. All beneficial use (BU) options showed lower environmental indicator scores than those associated with landfilling, in addition to net potential environmental benefits. From an environmental perspective, results suggest that, only in a few situations, beneficially using wood ash might not produce potential net environmental benefits but would still be preferred over landfilling, and in a very few cases, landfilling would be preferred over a BU option. For instance, net environmental benefits may be compromised if wood ash needs to be transported over long distances before it can be beneficially used. Out of the four BU options evaluated, the use of wood ash in concrete to replace Portland cement showed the greatest potential environmental benefits. However, the application of wood ash on agricultural or forest land showed greater environmental benefits than the use in concrete in cases where both its liming and fertilizing potentials are assumed to be achieved at the same time.",

		"abstract": "A ﬁeld experiment to test various management practices of sustainable forestry was conducted in a Swiss spruce forest for two growing seasons. Treatments were a control (C), yearly application of 4000 kg ha−1 wood ash (A), daily irrigation with a steady state fertilisation as ‘optimal nutrition‘ (F) and irrigation with a water control (W). Samples were taken on a 5 × 5 m grid once a year with a soil corer to determine ﬁne root biomass (≤ 2 mm) and soil pH of the topsoil. A subset of the ﬁne root samples was further analysed for its nutrient composition by CN and ICP-AES analyses. The dynamics of root growth were observed with the aid of ingrowth-cores after 1, 1.5, and 2 years of treatment and the growth pattern was analysed in terms of biomass, tips, forks, length and root diameter of the samples. The A, F and also the W treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of soil pH in the topsoil. The ﬁne root density increased over the two growing seasons, irrespective of the treatment. The root growth was only slightly different between the treatments with a initially faster growth under the A treatment. The W treatment reduced the number of root tips and forks, and the root length, while the A treatment increased the number of root tips, forks and the root length, but reduced the diameter. The differences between the three harvesting times (March 1999, October 1999, March 2000) of the ingrowth-cores stressed seasonal differences in root growth and the development of quasi ‘steady state’ root dynamics. The root turnover was not changed by the treatments. The elements in the ﬁne roots were strongly affected by the treatments A and F and sometimes by W. Fine root N increased with the F treatment, while C concentrations decreased under the A, F and W treatments. The Ca and Mg concentrations were strongly enhanced by A but also by the F treatment. The K and P concentrations in the ﬁne roots were improved by all three applications. Due to the pH increase Al, Fe and Mn concentrations in the ﬁne roots were decreased by the A and F treatments. S and Zn concentrations showed inconsistent changes over the growing seasons. The results of this study were comparable with those of other studies in Europe and conﬁrm the abilities of the ﬁne roots as indicators of forest nutrition, to some extent more sensitive than the commonly used foliar analysis.",

The Ca, Mg, DOC, Fe, SO24− and Cl− concentrations, mainly in the topsoil, were found to be higher at both sites, following dolomite treatment; Ca and Mg concentrations were 2–8 times higher (<820 µM) than in controls (<70 µM). Wood ash was found to have less impact. The PO4 concentration in the O2 horizon at Hasslöv decreased due to dolomite-treatment.

Treatments were loose and pelleted ash application (11 Mg ha-1), alone or combined with N fertilizer, and a control treatment. Nutrient leaching and soil chemical and biological properties were periodically evaluated for a 30-month period. Wood ash increased leaching of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) and P, mainly at the beginning of the study. The effect was more pronounced for the loose formulation. As a consequence, a positive effect on soil nutrient availability (exchangeable base cations and extractable P) and soil acidity reduction was observed for the loose formulation in the 0–10-cm soil layer. Carbon and N dynamics were only affected when ash was applied with N fertilizer, which enhanced CO2 ﬂux during the study period.",

In the forest ﬂoor, litter (OL), fragmented (OF), and humic (OH) horizons with average thickness of 1.5, 2, and 4 cm, respectively, could be distinguished. Three replicates of two wood ash treatments (3 and 6 t¨ ha´1) and a control were established in the autumn of 2012. Soil samples from OL, OF, OH and A-horizon were taken 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 months after the WA application. In soil samples chemical (pH, C and N content, C:N ratio, concentration of exchangeable Ca, Mg and K) and microbial properties (basal respiration, catalase activity, structure of microbial community based on BIOLOG assay) were determined. Our results showed that the changes in microbial and chemical properties do not occur simultaneously in particular horizons. WA application in autumn lead to a signiﬁcant increase in pH, base cation concentration, and distinct losses in C and N content in the OL layer in the ﬁrst month; however, at the beginning of the vegetation period, the most pronounced effect of WA was observed in OF and especially OH horizons; no changes were found in the A-horizon. Different properties of particular forest ﬂoor horizons led to a vertical stratiﬁcation of the microbial community. Each forest ﬂoor horizon had particular properties, leading to a vertical stratiﬁcation of the microbial community; deeper horizons had more homogenous functional groups.",

		"abstract": "Use of Kraft primary sludge and boiler ash in forest production systems holds promise as a cost-effective alternative to landﬁlling. From a soil quality perspective, particularly in coarse-textured sandy soils, increases in organic matter content from inputs of sludge/ash may improve soil chemical, biological, and physical properties. The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of a single application of sludge/ash at site preparation on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) survival and growth. In the summer of 2002, a 2:1 sludge/ash mixture from a Kraft mill was mixed into beds during site preparation at three levels: 0, 39, and 77 tons per acre. Loblolly pine was planted in February 2004, followed by N fertilization at two levels (0 and 125 pounds per acre) in May. First-year measurements of survival (SURV), ground line diameter (GLD), total height (HT), and height to live crown (HTLC) were taken in February 2004. HT and HTLC were used to calculate vertical crown length (VCL). All sludge/ash treated plots showed greater HT and VCL than control (CTL) plots. Results showed greater HT and VCL in trees receiving 39 tons per acre with no fertilization and those receiving 77 tons per acre with fertilization. GLD was signiﬁcantly greater for trees receiving 77 tons per acre with fertilization. Second year results show similar results for HT but not for VCL or GLD. VCL showed less stratiﬁcation by the second year, and GLD had no signiﬁcant differences. There was no difference in SURV between treatments for either year. The sludge/ash mixture showed HT growth beneﬁt. Operational costs are somewhat prohibitive without more efﬁcient methods of transport and application.",

		"abstract": "Intensive harvesting of forest residues for energy production may lead to the depletion of organic matter and mineral nutrients in the forest floor. In order to restore nutrient content wood ash has been suggested as a fertiliser. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are involved in the nutrient uptake of forest trees and this study investigates the influence of intensive harvesting and wood ash fertilisation on the external EM mycelium in forest soil. Nylon mesh bags filled with sand were buried in September 1997 in field plots which had or had not been intensively harvested. The effect of wood ash on the production of external EM mycelium was studied in mesh bags amended with wood ash. Mesh bags were retrieved in May and October 1998. The relative amount of fungal mycelia in the mesh bags was estimated with phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The fungi colonising the mesh bags were mainly ( s 90%) ectomycorrhizal. Fungal biomass in the mesh bags was low in the spring but high in the autumn. No significant effect on EM fungal biomass was observed in the mesh bags collected from intensively harvested plots compared with those from control plots, but wood ash amendment resulted in 2.4 times more EM fungal biomass (P 6 0.05). The effect of external EM mycelium on the dissolution of wood ash was studied in mesh bags filled with wood ash, using mesh bags buried in soil isolated from roots as EM-free controls. The external EM mycelium had no effect on the dissolution rate of the wood ash. 80% of the potassium was lost from the wood ash within a month, whereas no phosphorus was lost during the experimental period (up to 13 months). ß 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The experiment was conducted on 30 Â 30 m2 plots, each treatment being replicated four times. Soil animals were sampled throughout the growing season in the third year after the treatments. As a rule, numbers of soil animals increased during the study period. Numbers of the only enchytraeid worm species found at the study site, Cognettia sphagnetorum, were lower in the plots with higher ash level and plots which have been burned. In the plots having these treatments, enchytraeid populations increased during the study period. Total numbers of microarthropods were decreased in the plots which had received the most drastic treatments: the higher ash level and burning. Only ®ve species of collembolas responded signi®cantly to these treatments. Multivariate analyses showed, however, signi®cant changes in the collembola community structure of all the treatments. Overall, soil fauna seemed to be quite resistant and resilient against unpredictable disturbances, like ash fertilisation and prescribed burning, the thick humus layer being a major buffer against chemical and physical changes. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of the study was to investigate the eﬀect of ash application at doses of 0, 3, 4.5 and 6 Mg ha−1 with three replicates on soil and soil solution chemical properties in a mature Norway spruce plantation in Denmark from 2014 to 2017. Un-replicated extreme scenarios of 15 and 30 Mg ha−1 were included. Soil solution from 15 to 60 cm depth were sampled each month over a period of 2 years and 9 months after ash application and soil samples were obtained after 2.5 years. The ﬂuxes of nutrients and heavy metals through the soil were calculated based on water ﬂuxes modelled with CoupModel. Geochemical modelling was applied on selected soil solution data to investigate changes in heavy metal complexation and mobility. Application of ash to forest soil increased both soil pH and nutrient concentrations in the O-horizon but not in the mineral soil. No changes were detected in the soil solution chemistry or in the speciation of heavy metal at doses ranging up to 30 Mg ha−1, and there was therefore no change in the mobility of metals caused by ash application. The un-replicated extreme scenario suggested that the O-horizon concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Zn could increase proportionally with increasing ash application dose, while no indications of changes in the mineral soil below 5 cm could be seen. Among the experimentally replicated treatments, only the Cd concentration at dose 6 Mg ha−1 exceeded the Danish legislation limits, in the O-horizon of 0.5 ppm.",

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate micro vertical changes in soil pH and base cations over time after application of wood ash on forest soil. A column experiment with repacked O- and A-horizon forest soil was constructed and treatments of 0, 3 and 9 t wood ash ha−1 were applied on top of the soil in replicates of three. Soil cores were extracted from the columns monthly over one year for pH micro sensor measurements of O- and A-horizon (0–5 cm soil depth) and at four occasions (62, 152, 278 and 363 days after treatment) additional soil cores were extracted for base cation analysis. Results showed that ash application creates strong pH gradients ranging from pH 11 to 4.5 within the top 1–1.5 cm of the soil, with the highest variation within the ﬁrst 50 days after application. Application of ash increases the nutrient availability. If micro scale variation is not considered, mean pH values can be a misleading indicator for the extreme conditions that can exists in the top part of the soil after ash application.",

		"abstract": "In the future, it may become common practice in Swedish forestry to recycle wood-ash, a waste product of the combustion of bio-fuel. As a consequence of the Chernobyl radioactive fallout in 1986, large areas of central Sweden were contaminated. Application of recycled wood-ash, originating from contaminated areas, to a previously uncontaminated forest, risks an increase in the concentration of radioactive 137Cs. We measured 137Cs radioactivity in different parts of coniferous forests in seven ﬁeld experiments. Measurements of radioactivity were made 5᎐8 years after an application of wood-ash equivalent to 3000 kg hay1. The sites, in a north᎐south transect across Sweden, have a background radioactivity ranging from 0 to 40 kBq my2, the higher levels are mainly a result of the Chernobyl fall-out. Depending on its origin, the radioactivity of the applied wood-ash ranged from 0.0 to 4.8 kBq kgy1, corresponding to 0.0᎐1.44 kBq my2. In autumn 1999, samples were taken from the soil, ﬁeld vegetation, needles and twigs and the levels of 137Cs determined. In addition, soil samples were analysed for extractable K. The highest 137Cs concentration was found in the soil. At six of the seven sites there were no statistically signiﬁcant effects of wood-ash application on 137Cs activity. This was despite the fact that the wood-ash had, in one case, added the same amount of radioactivity as the background. However, at one site with intermediate 137Cs deposition Ž10᎐20 kBq my2 ., there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in 137Cs radioactivity in the soil, needles and twigs from the plots treated with wood-ash. The decrease in radioactivity was partly due to the fact that one of the main constituents of wood-ash is K, which is antagonistic to 137Cs. Based on our results, it appears that application of wood-ash containing 137Cs does not necessarily increase the 137Cs radioactivity in plants and soil. However, some of the observed effects could be a result of the low number of replicates used in this study. ᮊ 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Chemical composition, leaching and dissolution characteristics were determined for the Draken wood ash, the dolomite used in granule manufacturing and the final granule product. The heavy metal concentrations in fly ash were within the limit values recommended by the Swedish National Board of Forestry for ash recycling, except for Cd and As levels which occasionally exceeded the limit values. The Ca, Mn and P levels were too low for nutrient recycling at the time. Adding dolomite insures that the levels of the important nutrients Ca and Mg are sufficient in the granules. After 7 months in the field, about 60 % of Na and K was leached out from granules. Between 20 and 60 % of trace elements Mo, Sc, V, Y and Zr were leached out after 7 months. The release of Ca and Mg was low, 1±5 % during 7 months.",

Propionate (7–268 µM) and malonate (2–34 µM) were the LMWOAs found in the highest concentrations at Hasslöv. Two other LMWOAs dominated at Horröd, namely citrate (18–64 µM) and fumarate (5–31 µM). The differences in concentration of most of the determined LMWOAs at Hasslöv were signiﬁcantly increased due to treatment. The LMWOAs comprised between 1.1–6.3% of the DOC at Hasslöv and 4.5–17.6% at Horröd. At Hasslöv normally 3–10% of the total acidity (TA) was due to LMWOAs and the average speciﬁc buffer capacity was 74 ± 22 mmol mol−1C. The total DOC concentration in the mor layer solution was ∼16 mM for the dolomite treated plots compared to ∼10 mM at the untreated plot. A major part of the increase in DOC at the treated plots apparently had a hydrophobic character and was of high molecular weight corresponding to 3–10 kDa.

We studied the effects of fertilization on the establishment of vegetation on a cut-away peatland in Finland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood ash, peat ash, biotite, or forest P–K fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Although all the fertilizers accelerated the revegetation of a cut-away peatland significantly, ash-based fertilizers had the greatest and most immediate impact on the formation of vegetation. Ash fertilizers especially increased the coverage of small fire-loving moss species such as Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid., Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., and Leptobryum pyriforme (Hedw.) Wils. in the early stages of the succession. Furthermore, the succeeding coverage of vascular plants improves nutritional conditions through the rapid accumulation and decomposition of plant-derived litter. The rapid formation of ground vegetation on bare peat surface after ash fertilizer application indicated that wood and peat ash are suitable for mined peatlands. This being the case, peat and wood ash should be regarded more as a recyclable constituent rather than as waste in afforestation of cut-away peatlands.",

We studied the effect of fertilization and afforestation methods on the early establishment of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings on a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of peat-ash, wood-ash, biotite, or PK-fertilizer were replicated in three blocks in different mixtures corresponding to 50 kg/ha of phosphorous. Birch seeds were sown in randomized halves of split plots, while other halves were naturally afforested. Natural afforestation was equal to sowing in terms of seedling amounts due to closeness of surrounding birch stands with abundant seed crops. After the ﬁrst growing season the greatest quantities and dominant heights of birch seedlings appeared on the ash-fertilized plots, whereas on the unfertilized areas both the establishment and growth of seedlings was very poor. On the other hand, the quantity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings was more than three times higher on the unfertilized areas compared to the ash-fertilized areas. The differences between the fertilized and the unfertilized areas accentuated during the four observation years. Our results support regular use of ash-fertilizers for the afforestation of cut-away peatlands instead of the ash being deposited as a waste in landﬁlls.",

		"abstract": "Afforestation is one of the most popular after-use options of cut-away peatlands in Scandinavia since it has both economic and aesthetic values and therefore the interest concerning the carbon stock often focuses on tree stands. Consequently, ground vegetation is readily disregarded in the present calculations of the climatic impact of afforestation. However, at the early stages of afforestation vigorous ground vegetation may have a major role in carbon sequestration. The biomass and C stock of ground vegetation and young tree seedlings were examined on an ash-fertilized and afforested cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different mixtures and quantities of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Betula pubescens Ehrh. seeds were sown on randomized halves of split plots while the other halves were left unsown. The plant biomass was harvested four growing seasons after the treatments. The live above-ground biomass of ground vegetation on a cut-away peatland was up to two times that of tree seedlings. Furthermore, the below-ground biomass of ground vegetation and tree seedlings was equal to the above-ground biomass, or even greater. In particular, the biomass of mosses multiplied on ash-based fertilized areas compared to the Forest PK-fertilized areas. Our study proved that at the early stages of afforestation ground vegetation was even more important in biomass production and C stock than tree seedlings. Consequently, our results suggest that ground vegetation biomass should also be considered when the climatic impact of afforestation of cut-away peatlands is being calculated.",

		"abstract": "In Finland, recycling of wood-ash as a fertilizer has been widely studied in recent decades in peatlands drained for forestry. Wood-ash is reported to promote tree growth without any signiﬁcant negative impacts on the environment and could, therefore, be a suitable option on cut-away peatlands, which are estimated to increase by 30,000 ha over the next ten years. However, the environmental effects of ashfertilization on cut-away peatlands or on ground vegetation are not well known. We studied the effects of wood- and peat-ash application on the nutrient content in soil and plants and on the heavy metal content in the vegetation of a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite, or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Both wood- and peat-ash fertilization ensured an adequate level of nutrients for the early establishment and growth of ground vegetation and birch seedlings in a cut-away peatland. Dense pioneer moss cover was important in trapping the heavy metals, such as cadmium, which are present in the ash. Ground vegetation of mosses and herbaceous plants also had a major role in the retention of the nutrients that could otherwise have leached from the open cut-away peatland area during the early stages of afforestation. Both wood- and peat-ash proved to be suitable for the initial fertilization of afforested cut-away peatlands, but in order to guarantee a sufﬁcient long-term potassium supply for tree growth, an application of biotite with the peat-ash is recommended.",

		"abstract": "The increasing use of wood fuels to replace fossil fuels in energy and heat production results in increasing amounts of waste in the form of ash. Since wood ash contains nutrients that trees need in the right proportions, except for N, it is a potentially excellent forest fertiliser. However, any harmful elements, e.g., heavy metals are also concentrated in the ash, which has raised concern about possible adverse effects that ash fertilisation could induce in the environment. A considerable body of new results has been published on ash fertilisation impacts on, e.g., heavy metal concentrations in berries and mushrooms, ground vegetation, soil microbial processes, greenhouse gas emissions and watercourses. In this review, we synthesise this information to map the environmental beneﬁts and risks related to ash fertilisation. We pay special attention to peatland forests, N-rich ecosystems where ash may induce considerable increases in timber production, but for which a thorough evaluation of environmental impacts has been lacking. The longest monitoring periods currently span more than ﬁve decades. In well-targeted sites, ash increases tree production and/or reduces soil acidity for decades. No enrichment of heavy metals in the food webs or leaching of heavy metals to watercourses has been reported. CO2 emissions increase in the longer term (10–50 years), especially from N-rich peat soils. Also, changes in plant community may be so extensive that ash application cannot be recommended where conservation of the original vegetation is required. Immobilisation of heavy metals in soil depends on the neutralising effect of ash on soil acidity. The most crucial question that remains to be answered is how long this effect lasts, and what happens thereafter. Future research should investigate further whether heavy metals may accumulate in plant roots, even if above-ground parts remain unaffected. Finally, the duration of the impact of ash fertilisation on the nutrition of peatland trees, as well as optimal schedules of repeated fertilisations for different rotations, still need to be veriﬁed.",

One of the stands was growing on a peatland site (Muhos) and the other on a mineral soil site (Juuka). The stands were clear-cut and fertilization experiments were laid out with several treatments. At Muhos, the treatments included nitrogen fertilisation with different amounts of wood ash and an unfertilized control. At Juuka, the treatments included nitrogen fertilisation either with ash or with PK, and ash and PK treatments alone and an unfertilized control. The sprouts at Muhos were grown for 17 years and at Juuka for 20 years. At Juuka the stand was clear-cut second time at the age of 20 years and grown for 8 years. The stands were measured several times and foliar samples were taken twice during the study period. Clear-cutting increased stem number manifold. The stand density of new coppiced forests after the clear-cutting decreased from 67 000–89 000 stems ha–1 at the age of 3–6 years to 10 000–12 000 stems ha–1 at the age of 17–20 years.

The aims were to compare ash types (wood, peat and coal ash), study the effects of ash treatment (pelletization), compare ash fertilization with commercial fertilizers, and to study the interaction between ash fertilization and weed control. Foliar samples were collected 1–3 years and 7–8 years after fertilization. In the unfertilized plots, the foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were fairly high, while those of potassium were low in all the experiments. The boron levels were low in three out of the four experiments. Application of either loose or pelletized wood ash, as well as of commercial fertilizers, increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, and thus successfully remedied the existing nutrient imbalances and deﬁciencies. Since phosphorus deﬁciencies are rarely encountered on ﬁeld afforestation sites, poorquality wood ash with low phosphorus concentration could be used. Peat ash containing phosphorus, but only small amounts of potassium and boron, was not found to be very suitable for soil amelioration in connection with ﬁeld afforestation. Coal ash, containing only small amounts of potassium, was a good source of boron for pine even when used in small amounts, and thus it can be used in cases where boron deﬁciencies alone are encountered. Wood ash signiﬁcantly increased the height growth of Scots pines in two of the experiments, but peat ash and coal ash had no statistically signiﬁcant effect. Wood ash increased the number of healthy seedlings. Vegetation control decreased seedling mortality by 24%, increased the growth of pine and decreased the proportion of trees damaged by elk and by deciduous trees.",

Dense, naturally regenerated 16-year-old birch stands were cut down, fertilized with either wood ash (P 108 and K 339 kg ha–1) or PK fertilizer (P 50 and K 95 kg ha–1) or left unfertilized. The biomass production of the coppiced stands and one uncut stand was monitored for a period of 21 years. Soil nutrient and foliar nutrient concentrations were analyzed several times during the study period. Ash fertilization supplied more nutrients than PK fertilization and increased the soil nutrient amounts more. The foliar phosphorus concentration of birch on control plots indicated a severe phosphorus deficiency which was removed by PK and ash fertilization. Fertilization did not increase nutrient concentrations of the stem (wood + bark) nor the amount of nutrients bound in the biomass. Two energy wood rotations (16+21 years) produced 124–158 Mg ha–1 of leafless, above-ground biomass altogether corresponding to 61–78 Mg ha–1 of carbon. The highest biomass yield was achieved with a rotation of 37 years in the uncut stand (211 Mg ha–1). Corresponding values for mean annual increment (MAI) were 3.4–4.3 Mg ha–1 and 5.7 Mg ha–1. This study shows that the length of the rotation for birch in energy wood production should be longer than 21 years.

Weed control decreased the weed cover by 36–56 percentage points, vegetation height by 4–26 cm and thus shading of seedlings by vegetation for at least 4 years after planting. For the same period, ash fertilization increased vegetation height by 6–15 cm and shading of seedlings. Weed control reduced seedling mortality by 27 percentage points in 21 years, but ash fertilization had no significant effect. Ash fertilization increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, but its effect declined, and severe K-deficiency was recorded 21 years after planting. Up to the 9th year, weed control had a greater influence on growth than fertilization. Later the significance of fertilization increased due to an aggravated K-deficiency. Stand volume at year 21 for the untreated control plots was 8 m3 ha–1. Weed control and fertilization increased stand volume by 20 and 35 m3 ha–1, with a combined effect of 55 m3 ha–1. The effects of weed control and fertilization were additive and no significant interactions were found. Due to severe K-deficiencies, re-fertilization of all treatments would be necessary for the continued survival and growth of Scots pine.",

Recirculation of nutrients from wood chip combustion by ash spreading in forests has been proposed as a means for counteracting the nutrient export. This study was carried out to examine the effect of wood chip ash application on soil chemistry in a 44-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantation on a nutrient-poor soil in Denmark and to investigate the effect of applying different ash types and doses. Soil samples were collected and analyzed 2.5 years (3 growing seasons) after ash application. This study shows that, regardless of ash formulation, preparation or dose, application of wood ash to forest soil has a liming effect in the O-horizon manifested as an increase in CECe, BS and pH. This effect was not seen in the mineral soil within the time frame of this study. At the same time, an increase in Cd was found in the O-horizon, corresponding to the amount added in the ashes. Generally, no other increase in soil contents of the heavy metals was seen. Hardening of the wood ash did not decrease the chemical impact on the soil chemistry as compared to non-treated ash whereas an increase in ash application dose increases the liming effect.

		"abstract": "Increasing use of forest fuels for energy production is generating increasing quantities of wood ash. A common understanding is that this ash should be spread in forests to counteract soil acidiﬁcation and potential future nutrient deﬁciencies, and thus help sustain longterm forest productivity. A series of seven ﬁeld experiments was established in Sweden in 1988–1995 to study the stem growth and needle nutrient concentrations of 30–60-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands on mineral soil after additions of wood ash in different doses or a combination of wood ash and N. The results showed that the most pronounced growth responses occurred when N was added, either alone or in combination with wood ash. The stem growth responses to additions of wood ash without N were small and variable, and not statistically signiﬁcant at any of the studied experimental sites. However, there were indications that the addition of wood ash may increase stem-wood growth on fertile sites and decrease it on less fertile sites. In the short term, the addition of wood ash tended to increase the needle nutrient concentrations of most analyzed elements, except for N, but this could not be correlated to responses in stem growth.",

The amount exported is increased when the logging residues are also removed for use as fuel. Recycling of the resulting wood ash has been advocated as a measure to compensate for the nutrient losses and to sustain future forest production. The physical formulation of the wood ash may have an important inﬂuence on its effects on soil properties. In this paper, we report effects of two different types of wood ash (one self-hardened and crushed, the other pelleted), with differences in solubility, on soil chemistry in the humus layer and upper 15 cm of the mineral soil, at two coniferous sites in south-central Sweden, 5 yr after their application. The crushed ash was applied at three doses (3, 6 and 9 ton ha–1), while the pelleted ash was applied at only one dose (3 ton ha–1). At both sites the soil was podzolized. The two sites differed with respect to soil conditions, despite being situated only a few kilometers apart. The application of wood ash increased both soil pH and base-cation content in the humus layer at both sites. In the mineral soil, the effects were less pronounced. Treatment effects on soil chemistry did not differ between the two ash formulations. The retention (i.e. the extractable amount of nutrients found in the soil that could be attributed to the ash application) of nutrients varied strongly between the two sites, and K retention (ca. 10%) was generally lower than that of Ca and Mg.",

Generally, there were only minor changes in the vegetation cover as a result of the treatments, and the species composition was unaltered after five years. When treated with hardened and crushed wood ash, the three most common bryophytes reacted rapidly, displaying severe visible damage in the initial phase of the study period. Two years after ash application, the bryophytes had started to recover, and after five years no visible damage could be discerned. At the highest ash dose (9 tons ha-1), however, the cover of bryophytes was significantly reduced, even after five years. No visible damage to the bryophytes was found after treatment with pelleted ash or after N treatment, and no visible damage to lichens was found for any treatment. However, by the end of the study period, the addition of wood ash, including the pelleted ash, had significantly reduced the cover of Cladina lichens. All wood ash treatments tended to lead to a decrease in the cover of dwarf shrubs. Nitrogen addition tended to increase the cover of Vaccinium myrtillus and decrease the cover of Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Calluna vulgaris. The results from this study highlight the need for legal restrictions on the chemical and physical properties of wood ash recycled within forest systems, in order to avoid a negative impact on ground flora.",

		"abstract": "In industrialized countries, it is expected that the future generation of bioenergy will be from the direct combustion of residues and wastes obtained from biomass. Bioenergy production using woody biomass is a fast developing application since this fuel source is considered to be carbon neutral. The harnessing of bioenergy from these sources produces residue in the form of ash. As the demand for bioenergy production increases, ash and residue volumes will increase. Major challenges will arise relating to the efficient management of these byproducts. The primary concerns for ash are its storage, disposal, use and the presence of unburned carbon. The continual increase in ash volume will result in decreased ash storage facilities (in cases of limited room for landfill expansion), as well as increased handling, transporting and spreading costs. The utilization of ash has been the focus of many studies, hence this review investigates the likely environmental and technological challenges that increased ash generation may cause. The presence of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, chlorine, sulphur and silicon influences the reactivity and leaching to the inorganic phases which may have significant impacts on soils and the recycling of soil nutrient. Discussed are some of the existing technologies for the processing of ash. Unburned carbon present in ash allows for the exploration of using ash as a fuel. The paper proposes sieve fractionation as a suitable method for the separation of unburnt carbon present in bottom ash obtained from a fixed-bed combustion system, followed by the application of the gasification technology to particle sizes of energy importance. It is hoped that this process will significantly reduce the volume of ash disposed at landfills.",

		"abstract": "The direct combustion of biomass residues produces large quantities of bottom ash. Environmental sustainable management requires that ash recycling should be carried out whenever possible. Suitable applications of bottom ash are based predominantly on its chemical properties. The presence of major ash forming and trace elements along with other intrinsic properties unique to bottom ash, suggest its potential as a soil additive. But, ash quality must be of a high standard to prevent environmental pollution. This comparative study characterizes bottom ash obtained from three types of bioenergy systems - a fixed-bed boiler, a downdraft gasifier and a wood pellet burner. The chemical properties were analyzed and discussed for each bottom ash, together with their respective particle fractions that were obtained by sieving. The pH of the starting ash samples for the gasifier, boiler and pellet burner were 10.36, 12.49 and 13.46, respectively. Ni with a concentration of 229 mg/kg in the pellet burner ash, exceeded the maximum limit for soil amendments (in British Columbia, Canada) within the particle size fraction ≥ 850 µm but < 2000. All samples were significantly enriched in both Ca (50-61%) and K (10-26%). The elements Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, P and Na each contributed 10% or less to the inorganic portion of the ash. Concentrations of inorganic contents varied with particle size. Water soluble phosphates were very low in the samples. The results suggest that size fraction separation can be a useful method to isolate fractions containing higher (or lower) amounts of some metals. This method may be a useful technique for managing ash that contains elements exceeding environmental limits.",

We test this assumption by synthesizing results from long-term field trials in a metaanalysis. Overall, clearcutting significantly increased soil NO3-N concentration, NO3-N as a proportion of soluble inorganic nitrogen (SIN), N concentration in leachates, N flux, nitrification rates, and pH, but not total N, NH4-N, SIN concentration, ammonification, or N mineralization rate. The proportion of soil NO3-N in deciduous forests increased immediately and returned to preharvest levels within five years; the effect was delayed in coniferous forests, but levels remained elevated for several years. Deciduous leaf litter decomposed faster and needle litter decomposed more slowly on clearcut sites than in uncut forests. Single-tree selection caused smaller changes in NO3-N than removal of groups of trees (i.e., gap creation) and led to smaller increases in NO3-N as a proportion of SIN than clearcut harvesting. High levels of retention (>70%) were required to maintain uncut stand N-cycling characteristics. Postharvest NO3-N levels could be predicted from NO3-N availability in the uncut forests.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is a beneﬁcial fertilizer and liming agent in nutrient depleted soils, but it also contains considerable amounts of cadmium (Cd), which can be toxic to organisms in the environment. Therefore, risk assessments regarding utilization of wood ash is required. Here, we studied how wood ash (applied in doses equivalent to 0, 3 and 6 t ha−1) and Cd (applied in doses of 0, 10, 150, 300, 600, 1200 and 2000 mg kg−1) aﬀected growth of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The treatments were combined in a full factorial design. Wood ash alone greatly stimulated both soil respiration and growth of C. elegans, whereas Cd alone had a toxic eﬀect. However, unrealistically high Cd levels were needed to severely aﬀect growth of C. elegans and soil respiration, especially soil respiration was very resilient to Cd amendment. Ash addition decreased Cd toxicity to C. elegans, with an EC50 value of 390 mg Cd kg−1 in the 3 t ash ha−1 treatment, and an increase of EC50 to 1894 mg Cd kg−1 in the 6 t ash ha−1 treatment. This is probably because ash increases the Cd sorption capacity of the soil, and thereby decreases the bio-availability of Cd. The results suggest that there is no acute toxic eﬀect of Cd to nematodes associated with wood ash recycling; in fact, our results suggest that ash actually decrease Cd toxicity.",

The aim of the study was to identify the areas in which weathering and base cation deposition do not support leaching and uptake of base cations by vegetation. The effect of stem harvesting and whole-tree harvesting on the base cation balances was studied and preliminary calculations were made about the amounts of ash needed for compensation of the potential base cation depletion. The effect of sulphur emission reduction till 2010 was also considered. The study demonstrated that there would be depletion of base cations in forest mineral soils in southern, central and northeastern Finland (40–50% of the grids) in the long term if wholetree harvesting would be practised. Theoretical calculations showed that ash application would be most useful in those areas to compensate the base cation depletion. If stem harvesting is practised, only small areas (20%) in southwestern and southeastern Finland and northeastern Lapland would show depletion of base cations in the long term.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash fertilization increases the pH and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil solution and enhances the activity of soil microorganisms. However, it is unknown whether DOC or pH is primarily responsible for the increase in microbial activity. We designed an experiment to separate the effects of DOC and/or pH on soil microbial activity using suspensions of humus extracts and bacteria that had not previously been exposed to wood ash fertilization. After a 3-week incubation, DOC extracts were obtained from control (DOCC) and ash (DOCA) treatments with carbon concentrations of 9.1 and 32.5 mg C lÀ1, respectively. These extracts were supplied to bacterial suspensions at concentrations of 0 and 5 mg C lÀ1. We controlled for pH by matching adjustments, i.e. the original pH of the DOCC extract was 4.5 and its adjusted pH was 6.9, whereas the DOCA extract was pH 6.9 originally and pH 4.5 adjusted. The relative bacterial growth rate (RBGR), as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation, increased in suspensions of 5 mg C lÀ1 DOC as compared to control suspensions of 0 mg C lÀ1. At pH 6.9, RBGR was higher for both DOC extracts than at pH 4.5. These results suggest that both DOC and pH inﬂuence microbial activity. As the growth rate at pH 6.9 with DOCA was higher than with DOCC, the quality of the DOC extract must also play a role since the carbon concentration was controlled for. The decrease in relative abundance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids in DOCA compared to DOCC indicates a quality shift. As measured by DGGE banding patterns, the bacterial community structure changed over the course of the 24-h experiment in the following three trials, all of which received 5 mg C lÀ1: DOCC at pH 6.9 and DOCA at pH 4.5 and 6.9. These results demonstrate that both the DOC origin (control vs. ash) and the pH inﬂuence a subset of the bacterial community.",

The frost sensitivity was measured as an index of injury, calculated from electrolytic leakage of bark samples. Samples were taken from the same trees in August and November at ®ve sites. Two sites had been limed, one treated with wood ash and two had been fertilized with nitrogen, one of them with an additional phosphorous fertilization. Trees fertilized with nitrogen had signi®cantly more lesions than trees from other treatments. The bark was more damaged at À208C than at À108C in both August and November at experimental conditions. No clear pattern in temperature sensitivity was detectable among sites or treatments approximately seven years after soil treatment.

In the Ohorizon, all treatments resulted in increased pH and higher exchangeableCa, K, Mg, CEC,and percent base saturation; Mnand A! decreased. In the B horizon, exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, and percent base saturation were higher than in the control. Responses in soil chemistry were not generally proportional to the ash application rate.

Karst.) plots on peat soils, where fertilization trials with 0.5 to 2 kg m-2 wood ash had been conducted ten years previously. We examined the long-term effects of wood ash fertilization on fine root development (biomass and mycorrhizal colonization) and on communities of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and other soil microorganisms. Soil microorganisms were assessed by recording the number of colony forming units (CFU) from soil dilution series. ECM fungi in fine roots were evaluated by morphotyping and identified by sequencing of the fungal ITS region of rRNA genes. Soil chemical analysis indicated significant differences in soil pH between control and fertilized Scots pine plots, but soil pH did not differ among Norway spruce plots. Fine root biomass, numbers of living fine roots and numbers of dead fine roots did not differ significantly among wood ash treatments and the control for either pine or spruce. Relative abundance of living fine roots and its mycorrhizal colonization differed significantly among treatments and effects of wood ash were largely determined by tree species and amount of wood ash applied. Numbers of bacterial CFUs were higher in pine plots than in spruce plots and some differences were evident between the wood ash treatments and the control. Numbers of fungal CFUs were similar in all treatments. Of 21 fungal species identified on fine roots, the most common were Amphinema byssoides, Agaricomycetes sp., Lactarius sp. and Tuber anniae. Species composition of ECM fungi was mainly determined by the host species. However, principal component analysis and comparison of relative abundances of some species indicated differences in species composition among wood ash treatments. In conclusion, our data provided some evidence of a long-term effect of wood ash fertilization on soil pH, abundance of soil bacteria and diversity of ECM fungal community.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash additions of 3.3 and 6.6 t ha−1 reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a spruce forest (Picea abies) on a minerotrophic drained organic soil. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using static dark chambers for two years following the ash treatment. The CO2 emission from the soil was signiﬁcantly reduced by 17–23% by both doses during 2006–2008. The mechanism behind the reduction could not be related to a direct inhibition of soil C mineralization by the ash. The emission of N2O was also signiﬁcantly reduced by 44 and 46% during the ﬁrst year, mainly due to reductions in the winter emissions. Similar reductions of 34 and 50% were found in the second year for the low and the high wood ash, respectively. Increased pH of the soil due to the ash additions may have caused the effect. The control and amended soils consumed ambient CH4. The low wood ash dose increased the annual net CH4 uptake rate by 9%, due to an increased winter uptake. No changes in tree growth could be detected over the short 2-year measurement period. The net effect of wood ash application was a reduction in the total GHG emissions during the ﬁrst two years after the treatment.",

		"abstract": "Two problems have become more topical in recent years – production of solid biofuel from wood and the utilisation of ash and organic waste, including waste water sludge. The purpose of this research is to model simultaneous solutions for both of these problems through their use as fertilizer and to identify useful indications for the use of waste water sludge and wood ash as fertilisers. Opportunities to boost the efficiency of the applications of waste water sludge by combined spreading with wood ash are addressed in this study. An experiment is carried out in vegetation pots with different proportions of peat, sludge and ash to determine the impact of stem and root system development related to chemical and nutrient availability. Due to these studies, it is determined that waste water sludge has a comparably small liming effect. The fertilising effect of sludge can be increased by the admixture of wood ash and dolomite. These materials reduce the acidity of the soil and provide additional nutrients. Using dolomite as a liming material in the amount of 10 t ha-1 secures a change in pH of 0.6–1.2 units in peat soil. Significant changes in pH were found just a few centimetres into the upper layer of the soil. The application of an equal amount of wood ash produces a faster effect in terms of neutralisation. The limiting element is phosphorus. However, the mineralisation of peat increases the percentile proportion of all mineral elements in substrates as well as heavy metals.",

To reach this goal, 70 parameters were studied. The main results showed that the two studied ﬂy ashes Soproline® and Sodeline® had a positive inﬂuence on soil characteristics especially the availability of metals, nearly 14 years after amendment. Regarding biological parameters, no positive or negative eﬀects were found by adding ﬂy ashes to the soil concerning soil basal respiration and urease activity. The fungal activity was even enhanced. In the same way, the ﬂy ashes had no negative eﬀect on the Diptera larvae community and a greater richness of larvae was even found in amended soils. Thus, this study conﬁrmed that aided-phytostabilisation using these ﬂy ashes should be an advantageous technique to manage metal-polluted soils and to recycle industrial wastes.",

		"abstract": "Soil amendment with biochar is evaluated globally as a means to improve soil fertility and to mitigate climate change. However, the effects of biochar on soil biota have received much less attention than its effects on soil chemical properties. A review of the literature reveals a signiﬁcant number of early studies on biochar-type materials as soil amendments either for managing pathogens, as inoculant carriers or for manipulative experiments to sorb signaling compounds or toxins. However, no studies exist in the soil biology literature that recognize the observed large variations of biochar physico-chemical properties. This shortcoming has hampered insight into mechanisms by which biochar inﬂuences soil microorganisms, fauna and plant roots. Additional factors limiting meaningful interpretation of many datasets are the clearly demonstrated sorption properties that interfere with standard extraction procedures for soil microbial biomass or enzyme assays, and the confounding effects of varying amounts of minerals. In most studies, microbial biomass has been found to increase as a result of biochar additions, with signiﬁcant changes in microbial community composition and enzyme activities that may explain biogeochemical effects of biochar on element cycles, plant pathogens, and crop growth. Yet, very little is known about the mechanisms through which biochar affects microbial abundance and community composition. The effects of biochar on soil fauna are even less understood than its effects on microorganisms, apart from several notable studies on earthworms. It is clear, however, that sorption phenomena, pH and physical properties of biochars such as pore structure, surface area and mineral matter play important roles in determining how different biochars affect soil biota. Observations on microbial dynamics lead to the conclusion of a possible improved resource use due to co-location of various resources in and around biochars. Sorption and thereby inactivation of growth-inhibiting substances likely plays a role for increased abundance of soil biota. No evidence exists so far for direct negative effects of biochars on plant roots. Occasionally observed decreases in abundance of mycorrhizal fungi are likely caused by concomitant increases in nutrient availability, reducing the need for symbionts. In the short term, the release of a variety of organic molecules from fresh biochar may in some cases be responsible for increases or decreases in abundance and activity of soil biota. A road map for future biochar research must include a systematic appreciation of different biochar-types and basic manipulative experiments that unambiguously identify the interactions between biochar and soil biota.",

Sweden is at the forefront of research and development on forest-based bioenergy and has employed a model of science-based policy development to implement bioenergy production systems. In response to environmental concerns over whole-tree harvesting for bioenergy in Sweden, a number of government-funded research programs on forest-derived bioenergy have been undertaken with the intent of generating knowledge about the effects of whole-tree harvesting, ash recycling and bioenergy-related silvicultural practices on ecological systems and values such as soil, nutrient balances, water, biodiversity, greenhouse gas balances and recreation. Sweden developed a series of recommendations and good-practice guidelines for whole tree harvesting starting in 1986 and ending with the most recent revision in 2008. These guidelines and regulations are based on various scientific studies and include prescriptions and mandates to minimize environmental damage caused by whole tree harvesting for bioenergy. From the beginning, the process of developing effective guidelines and regulations governing whole tree harvesting in Sweden has been informed by science. Guidelines and regulations govern the areas of site productivity, utilization of recycled wood ash, biodiversity and physical damage to trees and soils. Overall, Sweden’s experience demonstrates the way in which science can be used to inform guidelines and policies.",

		"abstract": "Increased use of bioenergy has increased the production of wood ash in power plants. Wood ash is used as a fertilizer to improve tree stand growth in nitrogen-rich peatland forests. Nutrients removed during tree harvest are recycled back to the forest by wood ash fertilization. However, there is a risk that ash enhances microbial processes and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production in peat. Because there are difﬁculties in spreading loose ash, ash is nowadays granulated or hardened in other ways before it is applied as fertilizer. Granulation process changes not only the physical but also the chemical properties of ash. In previous studies wood ash has showed variable effects on N2O emissions. Nevertheless, there are indications that in laboratory conditions granulated wood ash decreases N2O production. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the capability of granulated wood ash to decrease N2O production in peat soils and the role of nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation in N2O production. Acetylene inhibition experiments showed that N2O production was dominated by nitriﬁcation over denitriﬁcation. The rate of nitriﬁcation as well as N2O production from nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation decreased by the addition of granulated wood ash. Wood ash addition increased peat electrical conductivity while peat pH remained unchanged. The inhibitory effect of ash was associated to ion content because isolated ion addition experiments produced a similar decline in N2O production. The inhibition of ions was more evident in acidic conditions because when peat pH was increased by addition of lime, the ions or granulated ash inhibited N2O production signiﬁcantly less than they did at natural peat pH. Our results show that manipulation of ion strength could offer a new tool to slow nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation processes and decrease the associated N2O emissions in acidic soils.",

		"abstract": "The responses of soil microarthropod communities of acid forest soils to wood ashapplication was studied both in a sixty years old pine forest stand (wood ash dose: 3000 kg ha-1) and in laboratory microcosms (wood ash dose: 5000 kg ha-1). We also tested whether microarthropod communities stressed with wood ash were more sensitive to an additional disturbance, drought, than the microarthropod communities in the ash-free soil. Microarthropods were sampled five times during the field experiment and four times during the laboratory experiment. At each sampling the abundance and community structure of microarthropods were analysed. In the field the number of collembolans, and in the laboratory the number of mesostigmatid mites decreased after ash-treatment. Although in both experiments the number of oribatid mite species was lower in the ash-treated than in the control soil, principal component analysis revealed no changes in the community structure of microarthropods after the ash application. Drought had no influence on soil microarthropods. It is concluded that soil microarthropods, at least at the community level, are rather resistant to substantial changes in soil pH even though changes at the species level can take place, and that microarthropods stressed with wood ash are not more susceptible to other disturbance (drought) than microarthropod communities in the ash-free soils.",

Coniferous forest soil, inoculated with soil microbes and nematodes, was either treated with wood ash or left as ash-free control. Wood ash (corresponding to an amount of 5000 kg ha−1) was either spread on the soil surface or mixed into the soil. Enchytraeid and pine seedling biomass, abundance of nematodes, and water leachable NH4+-N and NO3−-N were measured 26 and 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment and root length and N concentration of needles were measured 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment. Wood ash when mixed into the soil, reduced the biomass of C. sphagnetorum. Nematodes were unaffected by the treatments. In the ash-free soils C. sphagnetorum had little inﬂuence on pine growth, but it did decrease root length and root to shoot ratio. In the absence of enchytraeids wood ash decreased pine biomass production and root length. However, the presence of enchytraeids in the ash-treated soil compensated the ashinduced negative effects on the pine performance. Enchytraeids increased and wood ash decreased water leachable NH4+-N in the presence but not in the absence of enchytraeids, while water leachable NO3−-N was not affected by the treatments. It was concluded that C. sphagnetorum can be important in ensuring nutrient cycling and plant growth in situations when an ecosystem encounters disturbances.",

		"abstract": "A 3 yr experiment, using ®eld lysimeters with seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) growing in raw humus, was established to study how functional complexity of the soil decomposer food web affects ecosystem functioning. The functional complexity of decomposer system was manipulated by (1) allowing either microfauna (®ne mesh) or microfauna 1 mesofauna (coarse mesh) to enter the initially defaunated systems, and (2) treating half of the lysimeters with wood ash. To test whether altering functional complexity of the decomposer community is related to the system's ability to resist disturbance, the lysimeters were later on disturbed with drought. Ecosystem function, measured as leaching of mineral N and dissolved organic C (DOC) and primary production, and the structure and biomass of soil fauna and soil microbial communities were analysed. We hypothesised that reduced functional complexity of soil decomposer communities retards system functioning which results in impaired ability of soil systems to resist disturbance. Fine mesh was effective in reducing biomass of mesofauna, especially that of microarthropods, in the lysimeters. Leaching of N from the lysimeters and microbial communities were unaffected by the mesh size. Before drought, more DOC was leached from the lysimeters with ®ne mesh. Pine seedling development was poorer in the lysimeters with coarse mesh than in those with ®ne mesh. Wood ash, independently of the mesh size, increased number of nematodes and leaching of NO32±N (only after drought), decreased leaching of NH41±N and changed microbial community structure. The conditions for the pine seedlings were less favourable in the ash-treated than in the ash-free soils as indicated by the higher root-to-shoot ratio in the former lysimeters. The system's ability to resist disturbance was not affected by the treatments. Our results suggest that the abiotic factors (e.g. moisture, pH) overrode the biotic factors in the lysimeters with respect to ecosystem functioning, and that the changes in the structure and biomass of soil fauna were not re¯ected as changes in system functioning. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We established a laboratory experiment to study whether the effects of Cognettia sphagnetorum (Enchytraeidae) and ectomycorrhizal fungi on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedling growth are inﬂuenced by wood ash application. Acidic coniferous forest soil was treated with wood ash at 5000 kg haÀ1 or left as ash-free control and inoculated with soil saprotrophic microbes and nematodes. The microcosms were destructively sampled 26 and 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment. We measured enchytraeid and pine seedling biomass, abundance of nematodes and leaching of NH4+-N and NO3À-N at both samplings, and root length and N concentration of pine needles at the end of the experiment. On average enchytraeids and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced pine biomass production in the ash-free control soils, however, their impact was most pronounced when these organisms were alone in the systems. In fact, mycorrhizas tended to have a negative impact on the seedlings in the presence of enchytraeids. Wood ash had a clear negative impact on enchytraeid populations. Wood ash decreased pine growth when enchytraeids and EM-fungi were alone in the systems, but when together they apparently compensated for the negative effects of wood ash on the seedlings. It is concluded that interactions between soil fauna, mycorrhizal fungi and plants are context dependent, thereby rendering predictions of the outcome of species interactions in soil food webs a demanding task.",

Part of the sample population was from sites that had been treated with ash 1.5 years earlier, part from untreated control sites. The ash increased the soil pH and gave an average cadmium load in soil of 44 g haϪ1. When comparing treated and control areas, we found slightly but significantly lower Cd concentrations in vole muscle, liver, and kidney from treated plots, whereas the Cd concentrations in shrew tissues were greater in animals from treated plots. In voles we detected an increase in Cd concentrations during the 45-d sampling period in treated and untreated plots. The relative weight of kidneys was greater from the ash-treated areas than untreated areas for both voles and shrews.

Cadmium concentrations of some forest insects (Formica ants, carabids and Coleopteran larvae from decaying wood) were investigated in southern Finland, where two plots were fertilized with wood ash, while two other plots represented unfertilized control plots. In ants, mean Cd concentration was 3.6 ± 1.4 mg/kg, with nest workers having significantly higher concentrations than workers trapped in pitfall traps. Concentrations at fertilized and unfertilized plots were similar. In carabid beetles, the average Cd concentration of Carabus glabratus was 0.44 ± 0.36 mg/kg, with no significant difference between control plots and fertilized plots. In another carabid beetle, Pterostichus niger, mean Cd concentration was higher at fertilized plots compared to control plots. We conclude that the variation of Cd concentrations in the insects studied is more efficiently controlled by species-specific differences than fertilization history of the forest floor.",

		"abstract": "Whole catchment liming or forest liming has been proposed and implemented as a countermeasure to the effects of elevated sulphur deposition. Since the end of the 1980s the Swedish Forest Agency has undertaken experimental forest liming experiments in selected catchments in southern Sweden. These studies were with low doses (3 tonnes haÀ1) of lime (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Data from both soil samples and stream water samples have been collected for the 16 years following treatment. The stream data has been complemented with data from untreated catchments, from the Swedish monitoring stream network. Signiﬁcant differences due to treatment were seen for Ca, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (BS) in the humus layer, none of these variables showed a statistically signiﬁcant change in the mineral soil due to treatment alone. Soil samples from both the treated and untreated sites showed temporal changes in both the humus layer and the mineral soils with increases in pH, Ca and CEC and decreases in BS and Al which were independent of treatment. A combination of treatment and time, gave signiﬁcant changes in BS and TA down to 10 cm in the mineral soil. In the stream water samples no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed between treated and untreated sites. Regardless of treatment, the streams exhibited a general pattern of declining concentrations of SO4, Ca, sum of base cations (BC) and increasing acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). In summary, the application of a low dose of lime (3 tonnes haÀ1) did not result in signiﬁcant changes in surface water chemistry in the study catchments and changes in soil chemistry were mainly restricted to the humus layer during the 16 years following treatment. The natural recovery, as a result of reductions in sulphur deposition, dominated the effects and was clearly seen in both the treated and untreated study sites. MAGIC simulations indicate that this recovery will continue in the coming decades.",

The model suggested that cation exchange was the main process determining concentrations of soil solutions in all cases where neutral salt solutions were added, and that proton buffering was achieved by the dissolution of Al(OH)3 which was followed by Al3+ adsorption. Calculation of ion activity products in solutions from various batch experiments in soil + ash mixtures suggested that magnesian calcites of differing solubility may be in equilibrium with the activities of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in solution. An incongruent dissolution of Mg resulted in less soluble magnesian calcites in the ash. The model estimated satisfactorily the pH and the sorption of ions for all experiments with differing ash additions to the soil. Most of the Ca and signi®cant amounts of Mg added in the ash are expected to remain for a long time in the soil and may determine the Ca and Mg status of the soil solution, primarily controlled by principles of solubility products.",

Comparative-analytical studies were conducted in seven sample plots treated with different doses of wood ash (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2) and in a control plot without treatment. For anatomical analyses cross-sections of needles of one and two-year-old were made. These were stained, photographed under microscope and measured. Analysis showed that, in general, the current-year needles had the largest average value of anatomical characteristics in all sample plots. At the same time the xylem of the needles of pines from the sample plot with wood ash application of 1.0 kg m2 and from the control plot increased with age. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the anatomical characteristic between the needles from trees growing on sample plots treated with 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2 and the control plot were detected. The greatest anatomical differences between these needles were detected in the oldest needles. Histochemical analysis showed a greater degree of lignification of cellular walls in older needles and more intensive accumulation of lignin in the needles from sample plots treated with 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2. Morphological measurements showed the positive trends in the length and mass of needles at 0.25 kg m2 wood ash doses.",

The aim of the present work was to study the leaching of a range of physiologically important ions after different treatments representing high loads of N and other acidifying substances, as well as the effects of treatments aimed to counteract soil acidi®cation (additions of lime, ash and vitality fertilizer). We compared the leaching from two types of lysimeters (``ingrowth'' with, and ``trenched'' without, active tree roots) at two sites in the south and two sites in the north of Sweden. Generally, considerably larger amounts of ions were leached from trenched than ingrowth cores, and from the southern as compared to the northern sites. Additions of N caused, in the presence of tree roots, increased leaching of inorganic N in the north, and in the south of not just N, but also Ca, Mg, Mn and Al. Liming caused increased NO3À leaching only in the absence of roots at an N-rich site. Indications of soil Mg depletion were found after limestone addition. Vitality fertilizer caused no change in the leaching of ions in ingrowth cores. The study emphasizes the importance of tree root uptake, i.e. of healthy forest stands, to counteract the acidifying leaching of base cations, as well as Al and NO3À from mineral soils. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

		"abstract": "Anthropogenic acid deposition causes forest soil acidiﬁcation and perturbation of the soil forming processes. The impact of soil acidiﬁcation on tree growth is discussed in view of the role of mycorrhizal fungi in weathering and nutrient uptake. A review has been carried out of experiments involving treatments of forest soil by lime and wood ash, where soil properties and soil solution composition have been investigated. Results from these experiments in Europe and North America are summarized. In general, the content of C in the mor layer decreased as a result of treatment due to higher microbial activity and soil respiration as well as increased leakage of DOC. In addition, the content of N in the mor layer, in general, decreased after treatment and there are occasional peaks of high NO3 concentrations in soil solution. In nearly all reviewed investigations the pH of the deep mineral soil solution decreased and Al, SO4 and NO3 concentrations increased after treatment. These effects are probably due to the high ionic strength and increased microbial activity as a consequence of the treatments. In the soil, pH, CEC and base saturation increased in the upper horizons, but decreases in the upper mineral soil are also reported. In general, there was no increase in tree growth as a result of these treatments. The positive effects of the treatments on soil processes and tree growth are therefore questionable. In view of these conclusions, an investigation was carried out on the soil and soil solution chemistry and the role of mycorrhizal fungi in a spruce stand treated with two doses of lime and another treated with lime/ash in southern Sweden. The results of this investigation is reported in this volume.",

Thus, in 1990, a harvesting study with three main treatments was conducted in an old-ﬁeld white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stand in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The treatments included whole-tree harvesting (WTH) with chain saws, in which almost all the aboveground biomass was removed from the site, stem-only (SO) harvest, consisting of chainsaw felling and removal of only the merchantable boles from the site, and control (CON), an uncut area. Glass-body lysimeters, connected to hanging-bottle vacuum generators, were installed at three depths to collect soil solution. The leachates collected over a 6-year period (1991–1997) were analyzed for pH and various anions and cations. Soil temperatures were also measured at three depths.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden application of granulated wood ash has been suggested as a method to supplement nutrient loss resulting from harvesting of forest residues for bioenergy production. Mycelia of two ectomycorrhizal fungi Piloderma sp. 1 and Ha-96-3, were commonly found to colonise ash granules in a wood ash fertilised spruce forest. Thirty-eight fungal isolates were selected from 10 taxa to investigate the possible role of different ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient mobilisation from ash. The taxa were Cenococcum geophilum Fr., Piloderma croceum Erikss. and Hjortst., Piloderma sp. 1, Thelephora terrestris (Ehrenb.) Fr., Tylospora fibrillosa Donk, and five unidentified species, all originating from a wood ash fertilised spruce forest. The isolates were tested for their ability to solubilise tricalcium phosphate (TCP) or hardened wood ash (HWA) in vitro. Ha-96-3, P. croceum and Piloderma sp. 1 were the only taxa which solubilised TCP. Abundant calcium oxalate crystals were formed in TCP and HWA plates with Piloderma sp. 1. Ha-96-3 and two isolates of P. croceum produced intermediate amounts of crystals. Ha-96-1 and T. fibrillosa produced low amounts of crystal but no crystal formation was observed by any of the other isolates. Piloderma sp. 1 from HWA plates had significantly higher concentrations of P, compared to P. croceum or Ha-96-3. Piloderma sp. 1 and P. croceum were further tested for their ability to colonise wood ash in microcosms containing intact mycorrhizal associations. After 7 months Piloderma sp. 1 colonised ash amended patches with a dense, mat like mycelium, whereas P. croceum mycelia avoided the ash patches. Possible differences between these fungi in patterns of carbon allocation were investigated by labelling seedlings with 14CO2. Piloderma sp. 1 mycelia allocated significantly more 14C to ash patches than P. croceum. P. croceum allocated relatively more 14C to control patches than to the ash patches.

Soil cores were used to obtain estimates of the biomass (g mÀ2) of roots in three diameter classes (<0.5, 0.5–1 and 1–2 mm), root length density (RLD), speciﬁc root length (SRL) and mycorrhizal root tip density (RTD). Fine root (<1 mm) length production and mortality, and mycelium production, were estimated using minirhizotron and mesh bag techniques, respectively. Compared with the control plots (C), the biomass of ﬁne roots in diameter classes <0.5 mm and 0.5–1 mm was signiﬁcantly higher in A plots, but lower in SR plots. In addition, RLD was signiﬁcantly lower in the humus layer of SR plots than in the humus layers of C and A plots, but not in the other layers. None of the treatments affected the SRL. In all soil layers, the SR treatment resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in the number of ectomycorrhizal root tips, and the mycelia production of fungi in mesh bags, relative to the C treatment, but the C and A treatments induced no signiﬁcant changes in these variables. Fine root length production in the C, A and SR plots amounted to 94, 87 and 70 mm tubeÀ1 during the 2003 growing season, respectively. Fine root mortality in treated plots did not change over the course of the study. We suggest that leaving logging residues on fertile sites may result in nitrogen mineralisation, which may in turn induce reductions in root biomass, and both root and mycelium production, and consequently affect nutrient uptake and the accumulation of organic carbon in soil derived from roots and mycorrhizae.",

However, ash and nitrogen (N) fertilization may affect microbial processes producing or consuming greenhouse gases: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Ash and N fertilization can stimulate nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation and, therefore, increase N2O emission and suppress CH4 uptake rate. Ash may also stimulate microbial respiration thereby enhancing CO2 emission. The ﬂuxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 were measured in a boreal spruce forest soil treated with wood ash and/or N (ammonium nitrate) during three growing seasons. In addition to in situ measurements, CH4 oxidation potential, CO2 production, net nitriﬁcation and N2O production were studied in laboratory incubations. The mean in situ N2O emissions and in situ CO2 production from the untreated, N, ash and ash + N treatments were not signiﬁcantly different, ranging from 11 to 17 lg N2O m)2 h)1 and from 533 to 611 mg CO2 m)2 h)1. However, ash increased the CH4 oxidation in a forest soil proﬁle which could be seen both in the laboratory experiments and in the CH4 uptake rates in situ. The mean in situ CH4 uptake rate in the untreated, N, ash and ash + N plots were 153 ± 5, 123 ± 8, 188 ± 10 and 178 ± 18 lg m)2 h)1, respectively.",

The results obtained on the impact of wood ash on the concentration of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose in spruce tissues showed that the responses to different wood ash doses were often opposite in different organs of trees. The content of lignin calculated on dry matter basis was on average 25% in shoots and stems, 24% in roots and 10% in needles. The stems and roots of trees have the highest cellulose contents – 31% and 27%, respectively and no statistically signiﬁcant changes were observed after the treatment with wood ash.

The experiments were conducted with 1-year-old seedlings planted in vegetation pots. The pH of the substrate was increased by 0.4e0.9 units during the vegetation period compared to the control. The peat substrate was poor in nutrients, except N. The substrate treated with WA had higher concentrations of K, Mg, Mn, Fe, P, Zn, Cr and Pb, but a lower N concentration compared to the control. The substrate treated with PA had higher concentrations of Ca, Mg, N and P. The concentrations in the MA treatment were intermediate between WA and PA. The ashes increased K and lowered the concentration of Ca. A decrease in N in seedlings was found under the inﬂuence of WA and MA. An increase in K and P was found in all compartments of seedlings, while the concentrations of Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr in seedlings were affected irregularly depending on types and doses of ashes used. The uptake of Cd, Cr and Pb did not reach phytotoxic levels; however, increased concentrations of Cd and Pb were found in roots. A positive inﬂuence of ash application on growth was found.

		"abstract": "Use of biofuels in the form of logging residues is increasing in the European countries. This intensive forestry, where entire trees are removed from the felling sites, may contribute to a negative nutrient balance in the forest soil. Recycling of ash from the combustion of clean wood fuel, sometimes in combination with limestone or additives/binders, back into the forest soil could maintain the soil nutrient reservoir intact. Before spreading ash, it is important to determine its contents and, particularly, its decomposition pattern using reliable laboratory leaching tests. In this study, mineralogy and the leaching of Na, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Al, Cu, Fe, P, and Zn from wood ash pellets and granules, produced both from green liquor sludge and ﬂy ash, are examined by XRD and by subjecting these substances to three diﬀerent laboratory leaching tests: upﬂow percolation (CEN/TS 14405), batch leaching (SS-EN12457), and a new Swedish leaching test using a magnetic stirrer. Mineral phases such as quartz, ettringite, calcite, gehlenite, and aphtitalite were identiﬁed in the ash granules and in the ash/green liquor sludge granules, by means of XRD. Six additional minerals were detected in the granules of ash only, and another six in the ash/green liquor sludge granules. At L/S 2, the batch leaching test resulted in the highest amounts of elements leached and the upﬂow percolation test the lowest. At L/S 10, both the batch leaching test and the upﬂow percolation test resulted in high amounts of elements leached. The batch leaching test at L/S 10 complies quite well with the percolation test and could be suitable for ash/green liquor sludge granule evaluation in daily practice. The magnetic stirrer test seems to underestimate the release potential of elements from granules. The batch test is simple to perform, and has the ability to dissolve 70–80% of the elements with the highest mobility from the materials under study.",

In this study, we compared the effects of wood ash and PK fertiliser on the volume growth and nutritional status of Scots pine stands. The data were collected from 4 field experiments established on drained mires in northern Finland. The living trees were measured in 1996 - 2001 to reconstruct the stand development back to the time of the fertilisation. Needle samples were taken when 1520 years had passed from the fertilisation. The rate and the magnitude of the growth response were in direct proportion with the thickness of the peat layer and the N-status of tree stand. With similar doses of phosphorus, PK-fertilisation increased stem volume growth faster than wood ash. The effect of ash became stronger when 15 years had elapsed from the treatment. On oligotrophic and shallow-peated sites, where the stand was suffering from the lack of usable nitrogen, PK fertiliser had no effect on tree growth, whereas the effect of ash seemed to become evident after ten year. Significant increases in foliar concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, and boron were observed 20 years after treatment in all of the PK and wood ash fertilised stands. Ash treatment increased also needle dry mass and PK treatment decreased zinc concentration in needles.",

The nutritional status and volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) after varying doses of wood ash fertilization were investigated in seven field experiments located on deep-peated sites in Finland between latitudes 63°N and 67°N. Needle samples were taken 14–20 years after fertilization and trees measured 15 years after fertilization. Annual growth rates and differences in foliar nutrients were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA model. A regression model was used in the analysis of periodic relative volume growth. High doses of wood ash (100–265 kg P·ha–1, 225–450 kg K·ha–1) resulted in greater changes in foliar nutrient concentrations and in a stronger growth response than low doses (5–50 kg P·ha–1, 14–210 kg K·ha–1). Significant increases in needle mass and concentrations of P, K, and B were observed in the ash-fertilized stands, with a good status for these elements 20 years after fertilization. Depending on the ash dose, the mean annual volume growth was 0.5–1.4 m3·ha–1 higher than in the control plots during the 15 year postfertilization period.",

		"abstract": "A number of experiments have been established at the Finnish Forest Research Institute during the last few decades to study the effect of wood ash application on soil substrate, ground vegetation and stand growth on drained mires and mineral soil forests. In this study, the plots of 23 experiments were sampled to determine whether ash application signiﬁcantly increases heavy metal accumulation in forest berries and mushrooms. Both short-term (between 2 months and 4 years) and long-term effects (between 10 and 52 years after application) were studied. The heavy metal concentrations (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Cd, As, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Mo) were measured using ICP-AES. No signiﬁcant increase in heavy metal accumulation in the cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and bog whortleberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) or in the caps and stipes of russule (Russula paludosa), rufous milk-cap (Lactarius rufus), northern milk-cap (Lactarius trivialis), velvet bolete (Suillus variegatus) and in-rolled paxil (Paxillus involutus) was usually observed. In contrast, in the older experiments (13–52 years), the concentrations were often lower than those in the controls, except for As. Cd concentrations in cloudberry, bog whortleberry, in-rolled paxil and rufous milk-cap occasionally decreased signiﬁcantly. The results indicated that this ash-induced decrease in heavy metal accumulation may be a long-term effect. The concentrations of Al, Fe, As, Ni and Ti in the mushrooms were occasionally very high in the younger ash experiments (2–14 months after application); probably it was a case of surface contamination by heavy metal-rich ash residue, rather than active metal uptake. It was concluded that the heavy metals brought into the ecosystem by ash application are unlikely to be accumulated in any considerable amounts in forest berries and mushrooms.",

At the trial establishment in 1985, the trees were suffering from P and K deficiencies, but their N status was good. The fertilizer treatments were Control, PK (rock phosphate + potassium chloride), ApaBio (apatite phosphorus + biotite) and wood ash, applied both with and without N and replicated six times. All treatments containing phosphorus and potassium increased foliar P and K concentrations above the deficiency limits up to the end of the study period of 26 years. The effect of the fertilization on stand volume growth of Scots pine was strong and continued still at the end of the study period. The trees on ApaBio and PK plots grew nearly two-fold and those on Ash plots over two-fold compared with the control plots. In a thinning made at the end of the study period the total logging removal on fertilized plots was 1.5–2.2 times greater and included more saw logs than on the control plots. Ash fertilizer treatment outperformed other fertilizer treatments as well as the control. With a 5% discounted equivalent annual income (EAI) of Ash fertilizer treatment was statistically significantly (p = 0.009) almost three times higher than that of control. As a conclusion, fertilization (either using PK fertilizers or Ash) in N-rich drained peatlands is a financially feasible method of management.",

		"abstract": "Forested peatlands contain large pools of terrestrial carbon. As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha−1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efﬂux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efﬂux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.5–2 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efﬂux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m−2 year−1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efﬂux to 420–475 g CO2-Cm−2 year−1 on plots fertilized with 5–15 t ha−1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 11–12 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 43–58 g C m−2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m−2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efﬂux from the peat.",

		"abstract": "The application to soils of energy co-products derived from forest biomass (biochar [BC] and wood ash [WA]) with the aim of regulating soil hydraulic conductivity and water availability, thereby reducing soil erosion and increasing resilience to drought, has been suggested as a strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The main objective of this study was to investigate the eﬀects of BC and WA application on the hydraulic properties of contrasting aﬀorested soils in the Atlantic region of the Iberian Peninsula. Two experimental sites were established on acidic soils: site ES-K was established on a loamy soil (SOC% 3.9; pH: 4.8) and site ES-O on a sandy loam soil (SOC% 10.8; pH: 3.8). Biochar derived from Miscanthus sp. (pyrolysed at 450 °C: containing 87% C) was applied at rates of 0, 3.5 and 10 Mg ha−1 to soil in ES-K and at rates of 0, 10 and 20 Mg ha−1 to soil in ES-O. Pine WA (30% C) was applied at rates of 0, 1.5 and 4.5 Mg ha−1 to ES-K, and at rates of 0, 4.5 and 9 Mg ha− 1 to ES-O. Nitrogen- enriched (0.8% N) BC and WA were also applied at rates of respectively 10 Mg ha− 1 and 4.5 Mg ha−1 in both experimental sites. Bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), porosity and aggregate size distribution were determined and soil water retention curves (SWRCs) constructed. In ES-K, application of N-enriched WA (4.5 Mg ha−1) led to alterations in the SWRCs and reduced the available water capacity (AWC) by 11.5%; the lowest dose of WA (1.5 Mg ha−1) reduced Ks due to pore-clogging. In ES-O, changes were observed in the soil structure after application of BC (20 Mg ha−1) and WA (9 Mg ha− 1) as well as after application of the N-enriched materials. However, no eﬀects on available water content or saturated hydraulic conductivity were observed ﬁfteen months after the treatments. Further ﬁeld research is required to determine the soil speciﬁc, long-lasting eﬀects of BC and WA on soil structure and soil hydraulic properties.",

		"abstract": "Pulp and paper mills produce organic wastewater treatment residuals, inorganic process residues, and ash that have potential value as soil amendments in southem pine plantations. Chemical characteristics of 18 organic and 10 inorganic residues from 11 southem US pulp and paper mills were determined, and loblolly pine seedling growth response to their use as soil amendments was evaluated in two greenhouse studies. Fourteen of these 28 residues were then used in field studies in which they were incorporated into soil during establishment of pine plantations at three different sites. Under greenhouse conditions, seedling growth was increased by soil incorporation of most of the secondary wastewater treatment residuals at rates equivalent to 22.4 or 134.4 Mg • ha~'. In contrast to these greenhouse studies, under field conditions seedling growth was either unaffected or reduced when secondary wastewater treatment residuals were incorporated into soil at these same rates at plantation establishment. Seedling growth in soil amended with primary wastewater treatment residuals was generally no greater and in some cases significantly less than in the untreated control in both greenhouse and field studies. However, some evidence for growth improvement was observed when these residuals were added to sandy soils of a fiatwoods site. We observed little short-term growth benefit from incorporation of inorganic causticizing residues or ash in either the greenhouse study or in field studies of pine plantation establishment. Recycling pulp mill wastewater treatment residuals and process residues to forestland may be a viable recycling/reuse alternative, but growth responses will vary among materials and soil types and are relatively small. Secondary wastewater treatment residuals have the greatest potential to improve growth, but current silvicultural operations would need to be adapted to effectively use these materials. FOR.

Our aim was to test if ash induced decomposition activity was associated with enhanced turnover of recalcitrant, i.e. relatively old, organic pools. Two experiments were conducted in the same coniferous plantation after the application of 0, 3, 4.5 and 6 t ash ha−1, and 0, 3, 9, 15 and 30 t ash ha−1, respectively. We used natural abundance of 15N in mosses, mites and ectomycorrhizal fungi 26 months after ash application, as well as temporal variation in δ15N values of ectomycorrhizal fungi, as an indicator of decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter in the ﬁrst experiment. Furthermore, in the second experiment we used measurements of extracellular manganese peroxidase activity almost 4 years after ash application as an indication of potential decomposition of lignin, an important component of recalcitrant organic matter.",

In the first experiment, ash particle residues were extracted from peat and mineral soils 3 and 5 years after spreading and analysed for changes in element concentrations. Dissolution of different ash fertilizer products was also estimated by measuring the changes over time in the recovery of added nutrients and heavy metals in the surface of two peat soils. The results showed that potassium (K), sodium (Na), boron and sulfur are easily released from wood ash, whereas heavy metals are highly insoluble in all types of ash fertilizer products. Granulated ash fertilizers were less soluble than powdered fertilizers and the products stabilized by self-hardening. Minor differences occurred in ash fertilizer dissolution between peat and mineral soils and soils of different fertility. The most significant difference between wood and peat ash concerning their dissolution was the low solubility of K and Na in peat ash. Given the very slow dissolution of ash fertilizers, long-term studies are needed to understand fully the effect of ash fertilization on nutrient and heavy metal cycling in forest ecosystems.",

However, it has been shown that use of calcium phosphate fertilizers generally lead to highly increased P release to recipient water courses. On the other hand, no corresponding release has been reported after ash fertilization. Soil samples from the surface peats from a nutrient poor and a fertile drained peatland site were collected before and 1–4 years after application of five different types of ash products. The changes over time in the different chemical forms of P in the substrate were studied. The results indicated that the reason for the low liability to leaching of ash fertilizers was that significant amounts of P are adsorbed by Al and Fe during weathering of the ash fertilizers. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether the adsorption of P occurs with the Al and Fe of the ash or the native Al and Fe compounds present in soil before ash fertilization.",

		"abstract": "The interactive effects of site preparation (spot mounding) and fertilization (granulated wood ash) on soil properties, soil micro- and mesofauna and ground vegetation were studied in two Norway spruce plantations established in clear-cut forests in Central Finland. Half of the seedlings were planted on mounds created by the planting machine, and the rest on intact forest ﬂoor. Half of the seedlings on mounded and intact forest ﬂoor were fertilized by adding granulated wood ash to circular plots surrounding the seedlings. Initial samples were taken from mounded and intact soil immediately after planting in June. Samples were taken from all treated plots in the autumn in the ﬁrst and the second year after the treatments. Wood ash increased soil moisture percentage, the abundances of collembolans and mites, the biomass of enchytraeid populations, the pool size of water-extractable NH4-N in soil and the N concentration of spruce needles. Spot mounding had little immediate effects, but increased the proportion and abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes later on. In the second year, spot mounding increased NH4-N in organic soil and N concentration of the spruce needles, and reduced pH irrespective of wood ash addition. In accordance with general disturbance theories, our plots, particularly those disturbed by spot mounding, were characterized by bacterial-based food chains, and increased availability of inorganic N. The ash effects on soil organisms and nitrogen availability were better explained by increased soil moisture than by pH and conductivity, suggesting that the ash granules acted as inorganic mulch. Both wood ash and, in particular, spot mounding have the potential to increase N leaching locally. However, spot mounding may be preferable to other site preparation methods, because this method disturbs a smaller area of soil.",

		"abstract": "Afforestation is one of many different ways to reclaim cutover peatland areas . Among the treatments often required to obtain successful afforestation are supplementary drainage, fertilization and rotovation . This study presents the effects of drainage and wood-ash fertilization on the chemical composition of water in a cutaver peatland area, which constitutes 34 hectares of a minerotrophic mire in SW Sweden . Fourteen hectares of the cutover peatland was amended with 23 tonnes of wood ash, 0 .4 tonnes of raw phosphate and 0 .25 tonnes of superphosphate per hectare, while different doses of a PK-fertilizer were applied on the remaining 20 hectares . The chemical properties of groundwater and stream water in the wood-ash amended area were compared with those in the PK-fertilized area and a control area. Outflowing groundwater emanating from the mineral subsoil affected the chemical composition of peat groundwater and streamwater. Drainage changed chemical composition more than the wood ash fertilization . Drainage led to increases in SO4 and decreases in alkalinity in both peat groundwater and in stream water . The pH decreased in peat groundwater, whereas the streamwater pH was not affected because the high alkalinity in the mineral soil groundwater buffered the acid peat groundwater. Fertilization increased contents of K, Ca and Mn in both peat groundwater and stream water . Contents of B, o-P and Tot-P increased in peat groundwater but not in stream water, whereas the reverse was true for Mg . The outflow of P did not increase in spite of the large amount of P applied . The high retention of P was caused by large quantities of sesquioxides, especially Fe-oxides in the peat .",

This paper covers examples of case studies carried out at the mill and describes how the wastes and by-products are utilized as a neutralizing agent for acidic wastewaters (i.e., green liquor dregs from the causticizing process), as a hardener in ﬁlling mine cavities (i.e., ash from the ﬂuidized bed boiler), as a landscaping agent (i.e., ash as well as the ﬁbre clay from chemical wastewater treatment plant), as a hydraulic barrier material for landﬁlls (i.e., ﬁbre clay), and as a soil enrichment agent (i.e., calcium carbonate from the precipitated calcium carbonate plant). In addition, the wood waste from the wood-handling plant, sawmill, packaging pallet plant and from the groundwood mill, as well as the biosludge from the biological wastewater treatment plant, are all incinerated in the ﬂuidized bed boiler for energy production. Due to eﬀective utilization of the solid wastes generated at the mills, the annual amount of waste to be disposed of in the landﬁll has decreased between 1994 and 2004 from 42,990 to 6083 tonn (expressed as wet weight).

This combustion plant uses a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boiler for energy production. During the sampling period, when the bottom ash was sampled from the outlet of the boiler and the fly ash from the boilers electrostatic precipitator (ESP), approximately 97% or the energy produced by the BFB boiler originated from the incineration of clean forest residues (i.e. bark, woodchips and sawdust), and 3% from the incineration of sludge from the primary clarifier of a wastewater treatment plant. The current Finnish legislation, which regulates the utilization of ash in forestry, sets minimum or maximum concentration limit values for Ca, the sum of phosphorous and potassium, as well as for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni and Zn. Although the total element concentrations in fly ash were between 1.5 (K) and 40 (Cd) times higher than those in bottom ash, all element concentrations, as well as the sum of the phosphorous and potassium concentration in the bottom ash and fly ash, fulfilled the requirements of the Finnish fertilizer act for forest fertilizer, which came into force on 13 September 2011.",

Consequently, knowledge about the material fluxes of inorganic elements and compounds during biomass combustion for different kinds of biofuels and their influencing variables is of great importance. The results gained will especially influence the future design and control of biomass furnaces and boilers in order to prevent slagging, fouling and corrosion and to assist in the definition of quality requirements for biofuels as well as the possibilities of a sustainable ash utilization. For this reason, comprehensive test runs were carried out in several biomass combustion plants equipped with different combustion technologies and using various biomass fuels (wood chips, bark, straw and cereals). During continuous observation periods of at least two days, samples of the biomass and the different ash fractions were taken and analysed. Furthermore, the most important operating data of the plants were recorded.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden, large-scale recycling of wood ash to forests is considered a means of replenishing base cations, particularly Ca, taken up by the trees and removed by logging. To minimize negative effects on the forest ecosystem, slow rates of dissolution of the ash and release of Ca would be preferred. Carbonation of wetted ash [Ca(OH)2] can reduce the rate of Ca dissolution. In this study, field experiments were performed to evaluate carbonation of ash following application to forest soil beneath a spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst] stand. To accomplish this, a mass spectrometric analytical method was developed that allowed quantitative estimation and isotopic analysis of the ash carbonate concentration. The dynamic range was between 0.07 and 30 ␮mol of carbonate, measured as CO2 evolved from an acidulated ash sample, which corresponded with between 0.01 and 5 mg of a completely carbonated ash (dried) containing ≈0.30 g gϪ1 Ca. The method allowed spatially resolved measurements (≈1 mm3) of the amount of carbonate and the 13C/12C and 18O/16O isotopic ratios. Following field application, ash granules (8–11 mm o.d.) increased their degree of carbonation from ≈45 to Ͼ80% within 3 d and were Ͼ90% carbonated after 3 wk. For the initial 3 d, the rate of carbonation, Rc, was estimated to be 0.70 (Ϯ 0.33) ␮mol mgϪ1 dϪ1 carbonate. During the field carbonation process, the outer granule layer could either be enriched or depleted in carbonate relative to the interior parts, which is suggested to depend on the occurrence of rainfall. These results indicate that the rate of carbonation of ash granule Ca in the field is rapid and probably dominates over Ca dissolution, especially under favorable conditions.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is a residual material produced at an annual rate of 1.5-3.0 million tons by wood burning power plants in the USA. Up to 80% of the wood ash generated in northeastern USA is landspread on agricultural soils. Recently, concern has arisen regarding the t37Cs content of wood ash and levels of 137Cs of wood ash-amended soils. The 137Cs originated primarily from above ground nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. This study examined the total and pH 3, NI\"I4OAcextractable levels of 137Csand 4°K in three soils incubated in the laboratory with 0, 3 and 9 g of wood ash on a calcium carbonate equivalence basis kg -1 soil. The wood ash contained 137Cs and 4°K at 3920 and 21700 pCi kg -1, respectively. At the regulated wood ash application rate limit, 3 g wood ash (calcium carbonate equivalent basis) kg-1 of soil, there was no statistical difference from the control treatment in both total and soluble 137Cs and 4°K levels. For one soil, there was an increase in the 137Cs level when wood ash was amended at 9 g wood ash (calcium carbonate equivalent basis) kg -~ soil. The 137Cswas strongly bound to the cation exchange sites of the soils with the average fraction soluble in pH 3, NH4OAc solution at 4.8% in the mineral soils and 0.9% in the organic soil. Considering the current limits on permitted wood ash application rates to soils, there was no statistically significant effect on the levels of 137Cs or 4°K found in wood ash-amended soils.",

Although wood ash generally contains low levels of trace metals, release of some of these may occur soon after ash application in acid soils. The risk of heavy metal contamination associated with application of mixed wood ash was assessed in six Pinus radiata D. Don plantations, on two types of mineral soil differing in texture, drainage and CECe. Four of the stands received a single application of 4500 kg ha−1 (March 2003), and in the other two stands the same treatment was applied over three consecutive years (2003–2005). Trace metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) concentrations were monitored throughout the 3 years in different components of the forest ecosystem—soil solid fraction, soil solution, tree needles, ground vegetation and different mushroom species. Repeated applications of wood ash led to moderate increases in soil extractable Mn and Zn, and Mn in all mushrooms species. However, the maximum concentrations did not reach levels potentially harmful to organisms. Concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cd decreased in some mushroom species, probably because of increased soil pH caused by the treatment. Heavy metal concentrations in tree needles and ground vegetation were not altered. Although the risk of heavy metal contamination appears to be low, the long-term effects of wood ash application must be assessed.",

The accumulation and distributions of, and interaction between, Ca and heavy metals in wood and bark of two-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) were investigated in this study. The treatment was carried out for 3 months in nutrient solutions, and there was a low or a high addition of Ca, Cd, Cu or Zn. The metal accumulation in, and distribution between, the bark, the wood formed during the treatment period (new wood), and the wood formed before the treatment period (old wood) was analyzed with AAS. The contents of the metals in the stems (i.e., bark, new wood, old wood) increased with elevated addition of the metal in question, also at the low addition of Ca, Cu, and Zn. Interactions between Ca and the heavy metals were found. Elevated Ca additions decreased the Cd content of the bark and the Zn content of the old wood, and tended to decrease the Cu content of the bark and the Cd content of the old wood. The Ca content decreased in both, wood and bark after Cu addition and the high Cd addition. Thus, even small changes in metal availability and proportions in forest soil, such as after spreading of wood ashes in the forest, will be reflected in the content of the metals in the wood and bark of forest trees.",

Changes in the metal content of wood and bark of young spruce trees were found 3 and 6 years after spreading pellets of ash or ash+GLD compared with the control. The effect of the treatments on the metal contents of bark and wood differed and was larger after 3 years than after 6 years. Treatment with ash+GLD tended to have less effect on the metal contents of bark and wood than treatment with only ash. An increase in the contents of Cu and Zn in bark or wood, compared with the control, was only found for the ash treatment and only 3 years after application. Both the ash and ash+GLD treatment decreased the Cd content of the wood and/or bark after 3 years, and after 6 years it still was, or tended to be, lower than the control.",

Mill.) stands showing symptoms of tree decline or foliar chlorosis in boreal forests of eastern Laurentian Highlands in Quebec, Canada. In the ﬁrst trial, trees showed strong decline symptoms; fertilization treatments consisted of combinations of two nutrients among N, K, and Mg, each at two rates. In the second trial, trees showed some needle chlorosis; various doses of N, K, K–Mg, and K-lime fertilizers were applied. In both trials, N fertilization (200 kg N haÀ1) resulted only in a short-term (2–3 years) increase in foliar N concentrations and radial growth. Potassium fertilization (100–400 kg K2O haÀ1), however, led to an increase of at least 33% in both foliar K concentrations and radial growth, which lasted for the duration of the experiments (7–11 years). Liming (1–4 t dolomitic lime haÀ1) increased the pH, exchangeable calcium and exchangeable magnesium in the humus and top mineral soil horizons, but did not inﬂuence balsam ﬁr foliar nutrient status or growth. Tree defoliation rate was mainly related to growth decrease and foliar K concentrations. The trials also show that K was the most limiting nutrient for balsam ﬁr growth, and that the poor K nutrient status and vigor of balsam ﬁr trees can be corrected by K fertilization. These results contrast with past fertilization studies that generally reported N as the most limiting nutrient in these boreal ecosystems. Climatic events may have also played a role in triggering the decline of balsam ﬁr in one trial.",

Five months (ﬁfteen months for soil solution) and two years after wood ash application, control plots and plots treated with 5 t of wood ash ha–1 were compared with regard to heavy metal concentrations of the O horizon, mineral topsoil (0–5 cm), soil solution (20 and 50 cm depth), the dominant species of the ground vegetation (Pleurozium schreberi) and current and ﬁrst year needles of Scots pine. The clearest effect was found for the O horizon and the Scots pine needles. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn in the O horizon and the concentrations of Cr, Cu and Ni in the Scots pine needles were signiﬁcantly higher in the fertilised plots. Results showed that most of the metals were bound in the O horizon, therefore signiﬁcant downward transport was determined only for Zn and Ni 2 years after treatment. No ash inﬂuence on the leaching of other metals was found. The chemical composition of P. schreberi was not affected by ash fertilisation. Despite the increase of Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations in the current year needles, tendencies of decreased Ni and Cu concentrations were observed.",

Wood ash can be applied to energy crops as a fertilizer, which can help replace nutrients removed during harvest. The objectives of this study were to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of nutrient elements applied in wood ash to an intensively cultured, short-rotation willow bioenergy system. Wood ash was applied at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg ha−1 yr−1 to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP3, from 1992 to 1994. The relative abundance of nutrients in applied wood ash was Ca > K > Mg > P > N. There was little effect of wood ash on N or P concentrations in soil solution measured at 20 and 40 cm depth. Soil solution concentrations of base cations were elevated in the last two years of the study by 30 to 90%, depending on the element and treatment, in plots receiving wood ash. Wood ash treatments had little inﬂuence on foliar leaching. Wood ash treatment also had few signiﬁcant effects on willow growth or on the contents of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in foliage and stems. The addition of P, K, Ca, and Mg in wood ash was more than enough to compensate for harvest removals and leaching losses. This study demonstrated that wood ash can supply most nutrients removed during harvest in willow plantations, with the exception of N, without adverse effects on groundwater or vegetation.",

We tested whether wood ash generated when burning wood for energy could be used to ameliorate negative soil effects of shortrotation harvesting practices. We measured the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil nutrient properties after wood ash applications in a willow plantation in central New York State and determined the inﬂuence of wood ash application on willow growth. Wood ash was applied annually for 3 years at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg haÀ1 to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP3. Wood ash application signiﬁcantly increased soil pH in the 0–10 cm soil layer from 6.1 in the control to 6.9 and 7.1 in the 10 and 20 Mg haÀ1 treated plots. Wood ash application signiﬁcantly increased soil extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations. Potassium was the element most affected by wood ash treatment at all soil depths. Wood ash had no signiﬁcant effect on nutrient concentrations of foliar, litter, and stem tissue. Wood ash did not affect either individual plant growth or plot biomass production, which declined over the course of the study; it did increase the size of stems, but this effect was balanced by a decrease in the number of stems. Applying nitrogen as well as wood ash might be required to maintain the productivity of this SRIC system.",

The study revealed no clear response of the litter decomposition to wood ash application after four years. The biomasses of soil organic matter in the treated plots and control did not differ signiﬁcantly. Contrary to the expected results the biomass of the organic matter was greater in both ash treated plots than in the control plot.

		"abstract": "Wood ash contains all the essential plant nutrients except nitrogen, and thus supports tree growth especially on peatlands where mineral nutrients often are in short supply. Here we report the effects of wood ash fertilization on the soil microbial community in a boreal drained peatland, characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and more speciﬁcally the fungal community, characterized with PCR-DGGE ﬁngerprinting and sequencing methods. We investigated the microbial communities in unfertilized and ash-fertilized sample plots (loose wood ash 5000 or 15 000 kg haÀ1) 6 years after fertilization. Microbial function measured as heterotrophic basal respiration increased over 30% in the surface peat layer after wood ash fertilization, yet the result was statistically insigniﬁcant. The higher amount of wood ash induced a shift in the microbial community in the surface peat layer (0e10 cm) along with an increase in pH. A higher relative proportion of fungal-speciﬁc PLFA 18:2u6 and an increased fungal:bacterial ratio indicated that fungi beneﬁted from the higher amount of wood ash in the topmost layer. Also, the lower amount of wood ash seemed to have stimulated actinobacteria. Our results indicated that higher pH and extra nutrients due to wood ash fertilization promoted the appearance of mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi directly or via increased tree growth. We suggest that wood ash as a fertilizer would be a natural and economical choice to improve the nutrient status of drained peatlands used for forestry since it maintains the positive feedback between fungi and trees.",

A ﬁeld experiment, which included 3 treatments and 4 replicate blocks, was established on an acidic, organic matter-rich mineral soil. The treatments were two different doses of ash (10 and 20 t ha-1) and an unfertilized control. Application of the ash (by spreading on the ground) produced mean increases of 16% in diameter and 11% in height growth of trees during the ﬁrst 3 years, considering both doses together; the response was also signiﬁcant for the subsequent period, particularly with the higher dose of ash (increases of 11% in diameter and 15% in height growth). The ash had a marked effect, although clearly short lived, on pH (H2O) levels (an increase of 0.6 units) and on exchangeable soil K, Ca and Mg. The nutritional status of the plantation was improved, mainly in terms of K, Ca and Mg, and the results of a vector analysis indicated that these elements, particularly K, were limiting forest production. Foliar or soil nutrient concentrations in the mineral soil were no longer affected by the ash at age 12 years. We recommend the application of two doses of 10 Mg ha-1 throughout the rotation for fertilizing acid mineral soils that are rich in organic matter.",

The experiment was performed using two fertilization levels (3 and 9 t ash ha21) and repeated in two coniferous forest stands of different site fertility. It was hypothesized that the effects of hardened wood ash on soil microbes are of less magnitude when compared to loose ash due to the slower dissolution rates. The long-term effects of loose ash (3 t ash ha21) were studied in four forest stands of different site fertility 18 years after ash application. In order to study ash effects, the microbial activity (basal respiration- and thymidine incorporation rates) and microbial community structure (PLFA pattern) were determined. The results showed that irrespective of the forest site fertility, ash fertilization induced the same responses in the humus layer. It raised the microbial activity and changed the community structure. The changes were related to the dose and form of ash applied. Applying the same fertilization rate induced comparatively more changes to the loose wood ash sites than hardened wood ash sites, due to the detected slower dissolution of hardened ash into the humus. The effects of wood ash were long-term. Changes in the humus microbial activity and PLFA pattern were still detectable after 18 years. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

It has been shown that spiking ash with Cd to concentrations of 1000 mg kg31 induced no further changes in humus microbial activity and community structure as ash alone. To accelerate the weathering process and thus to liberate the spiked Cd from the ash, three treatments ^ wood ash (A), Cd spiked wood ash (ACd, 1000 mg Cd kg31 ash), both applied at a fertilization rate of 5000 kg ha31, together with a control (C) ^ were performed in microcosms and incubated in field condition under two types of irrigation ^ water and simulated acid rain. During the incubation period of one growing season the simulated acid rain plots received a sulfur load of 3.64 g S m32, which was 15 times more than the S deposition on the water irrigated plots. The treatments resulted in a mean Cd increase of the humus from 0.23 mg kg31 of the C treatment to 0.52 and 39.5 mg kg31 of the A and ACd treatments, respectively. The irrigation had no further effect on the result. The microbial activity, measured as soil basal respiration, and the microbial community structure, measured as humus phospholipid fatty acid and 16S and 18S polymerase chain reaction/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns, changed only due to the ash (A and ACd treatments) fertilization irrespective of the irrigation. The bacterial biosensor, emitting light in the presence of bioavailable Cd, did not react to any of the treatments.

Therefore, the objectives of this field study were to test if the Cd of wood ash has the potential to affect the coniferous forest humus microflora and if Cd enters the human food chain. These objectives were tested with ash (A) and Cd-spiked ash (ACd, 400 mg Cd·kg–1) at a fertilization rate of 3 t·ha–1. Microbial community structure, respiration, needle litter decomposition, growth rates and Cd tolerance of bacteria, and the bioavailability of Cd were measured. Also, Cd concentrations of humus, soil percolation water, mushrooms, fruits and leaves of berries, and needles were determined. The amount of Cd in the percolation water or bioavailable Cd, measured with a bacterial biosensor, and Cd tolerance of bacteria did not increase, although the ACd treatment increased the amount of humus total and extractable Cd. Only the ACd and not the A treatment caused Cd concentration increment in Lactarius rufus and berries of Empetrum nigrum. In spite of the high Cd concentration of the spiked ash, it did not have harmful effects on humus microorganisms during this 4-year study. Thus, wood ash is safe to use as a fertilizer in forests.",

Metal application increased the concentration of extractable Ni and changed the fungal community structure. In irrigated laboratory microcosms the abovementioned treatment effects were still seen except for the acid and metal effects on microbial and fungal community structures. For ashtreated microcosms, neither acid nor metal effects were found for humus layer pH, BS, extractable Cu and Ni, or bioavailable Cu.

		"abstract": "Environmental policies of the European Union (EU) aim to increase the amount of renewable energy and to improve the use of waste streams. This will increase the amount of ﬂy ash (FA) from biomass combustion, thereby increasing the need for its utilization. Biomass FA is a good fertilizer since it contains most of the nutrients that plants need. Sequential leaching would provide a more accurate assessment of the potential bioavailability of the harmful elements and nutrients than the pseudo-total and/or watersoluble concentration analysis that EU environmental legislation typically requires. This study investigated the effect of granulation and ammonium sulfate addition on the solubility and bioavailability of nutrients and harmful elements from peat and wood co-combustion FA by using sequential leaching and pseudo-total acid digestion. The recoveries of the easily bioavailable nutrients Ca, K, Mg, P, and S as well as the total bioavailability of Ca, K, Mg, and S reduced signiﬁcantly after granulation. Therefore, granulation reduced the fertilizing effect of FA. The pseudo-total recovery of Ca, Mg, and S reduced after granulation, indicating that these types of FA form some very stable silicate compounds besides the common self-hardening products. Ammonium sulfate addition increased the recoveries of the easily bioavailable nutrients and total bioavailability recoveries of the Ca, K, and Mg back to the same levels as those in FA. The total bioavailability of the harmful elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn was very low, and this does not limit the usability of FA as a fertilizer.",

However, a simple and fast method of determining the distribution of the ash and the extent of affected soil is missing. In this study we present the use of magnetic susceptibility, which is controlled by Fe-oxides, in comparing the fertilized soil in the forest plantation of pine and oak with intact forest soil. Spatial and vertical distribution of magnetic susceptibility was measured in an oak and pine plantation next to stems of young plants, where wood ash was applied as fertilizer. Pattern of the susceptibility distribution was compared with that in non-fertilized part of the plantation as well as with a spot of intact natural forest soil nearby. Our results show that the wood-ash samples contain signiﬁcant amount of ferrimagnetic magnetite with susceptibility higher than that of typical forest soil. Clear differences were observed between magnetic susceptibility of furrows and ridges. Moreover, the dispersed ash remains practically on the surface, does not penetrate to deeper layers. Finally, our data suggest signiﬁcant differences in surface values between the pine and oak plants. Based on this study we may conclude that magnetic susceptibility may represent a simple and approximate method of assessing the extent of soil affected by wood-ash.",

		"abstract": "The increasing use of wood and peat in energy production has created a potential to utilize wood and peat ashes as forest fertilizers on a wide scale. Previous studies have shown that tree growth in peatland beneﬁts most from ash fertilization. However, possible harmful effects on recipient watercourses have prevented any larger-scale fertilization activity. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term changes in runoff acidity and the transport of nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved organic carbon via drainage water from drained boreal peatland catchments fertilized with wood or peat ash. The hypotheses were that the site’s peat type, the origin and formula of the ash and the time of application have an inﬂuence on leaching amounts. Therefore, the studied catchments represented different peat (Carex or Sphagnum) and site types with different standing tree stocks (8–127 m3 haÀ1). Loose, self-hardened and drum-granulated ashes (wood and peat ashes) were used and applied (5000–6500 kg haÀ1) either in winter on snow or in summer on bare ground. Water samples from the runoff were taken over a 10–11-year period following the applications. After 10–11 years from the treatments, the concentrations of S, K, Na, ClÀ, and Mg in the runoff water were still higher at the wood ash treatments compared to the controls. Leaching of elements from peat ash was lower than from wood ash due to the lower content of elements. We estimated that 15–52% of the added S and 2–28% of the added K were leached from the wood and peat ashes during the study period. Leaching of S was the highest after the winter application and higher from the Sphagnum than from the Carex peat dominated catchments. The leaching of K was the highest after the summer application and was the lowest from the catchments having the highest tree stock. No increased leaching of P, N, dissolved organic carbon or heavy metals was detected.",

Plant establishment and survival in highly metal-contaminated soils are crucial for phytostabilisation success, as metal toxicity for plants is widely reported. A relevant phytostabilisation solution must limit metal transfer through the food chain. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the long-term efﬁciency of aided phytostabilisation on former agricultural soils highly contaminated by cadmium, lead, and zinc. The inﬂuence of afforestation and ﬂy ash amendments on reducing metal phytoavailability was investigated as were their effects on plant development. Before being planted with a tree mix, the site was divided into three plots: a reference plot with no amendment, a plot amended with silico-aluminous ﬂy ash and one with sulfo-calcic ﬂy ash. Unlike Salix alba and Quercus robur, Alnus glutinosa, Acer pseudoplatanus and Robinia pseudoacacia grew well on the site and accumulated, overall, quite low concentrations of metals in their leaves and young twigs. This suggests that these three species have an excluder phenotype for Cd, Zn and Pb. After 8 years, metal availability to A. glutinosa, A. pseudoplatanus and R. pseudoacacia, and translocation to their above-ground parts, strongly decreased in ﬂy ash-amended soils. Such decreases ﬁt well together with the depletion of CaCl2-extractable metals in amended soils. Although both ﬂy ashes were effective to decrease Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations in above-ground parts of trees, the sulfo-calcic ash was more efﬁcient.",

Although the metals were extractable in all fractions, the highest concentrations of most of the metals occurred in the residual fraction. This fraction is the non-mobile fraction and is potentially the least harmful. The concentration of easily soluble Ca (24.5 g kg-1 (d.w.) in the fly ash was ca. 15 times higher than the typical value of 1.6 g kg-1 (d.w.) in arable land in Central Finland indicating that the fly ash is a potential agent for soil remediation and improving soil fertility. Both types of ash were alkaline (pH ~ 9.4 – 9.7), which means that they have a pH - buffering capacity. According to the Finnish legislation, both types of ash can be used as a fertilizer in the forest. This paper covers also examples how ashes are utilized in some Finnish pulp and paper mills.",

		"abstract": "In Finland, the new limit values for maximal allowable heavy metal concentrations for materials used as an earth construction agent came into force in July 2006. These limit values are applied if ash is utilized, e.g. in roads, cycling paths, pavements, car parks, sport ﬁelds, etc. In this study we have determined the most important chemical and physical properties of the cyclone ﬂy ash originating from the grate-ﬁred boiler incinerating forest residues (i.e. wood chips, sawdust and bark) at a small municipal district heating plant (6 MW), Northern Finland. This study clearly shows that elements are enriched in cyclone ﬂy ash, since the total element concentrations in the cyclone ﬂy ash were within 0.2–10 times higher than those in the bottom ash. The total concentrations of Cd (25 mg kg−1; d.w.), Zn (3630 mg kg−1; d.w.), Ba (4260 mg kg−1; d.w.) and Hg (1.7 mg kg−1; d.w.) exceeded the limit values, and therefore the cyclone ﬂy ash cannot be used as an earth construction agent. According to the leached amounts of Cr (38 mg kg−1; d.w.), Zn (51 mg kg−1; d.w.) and sulphate (50,000 mg kg−1; d.w.), the cyclone ﬂy ash is classiﬁed as a hazardous waste, and it has to be deposited in a hazardous waste landﬁll.",

		"abstract": "Ontario’s forest sector is undergoing a significant shift owing to declining markets for traditional products; this shift is further exacerbated by a cyclical industry downturn. These factors are leading to extensive job losses in Ontario’s north as well as rural community upheaval. Governments are striving to reverse these effects by stimulating new industries focused on using forest biofibre for products such as fuel for energy, specialty chemicals, and polymers. In light of these new demands, provincial and federal policy and science experts are examining the range of potential forest biomass utilization opportunities in terms of their long-term implications for sustainability, role in an emerging bioeconomy, and the possible influences of, for example, a changing climate and technological advances. Current research and broad-scale monitoring projects are helping to answer several important questions in the ecological, economic, policy, resource supply, and technological realms, while new questions must be continually addressed. In this paper, we describe the legislative, policy, and administrative context in which the sustainable biofibre industry may exist. We argue that social, economic, and environmental goals for a sustainable forest biofibre industry in Ontario can best be achieved by adhering to the principles of adaptive management. Market forces and third-party certification, which can influence the biofibre sector, are also discussed.",

Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 621Á634. Wood ash is produced in large quantities in Canada as a by-product of the pulp and paper, sawmill, and bioenergy industries and it is anticipated that its disposal in landfills will not be a viable option. An alternative option may be to use it to amend forest soils. Wood ash is a complex mixture and its composition depends on several variables, including the combustion parameters of the boiler in which it is generated. We present an analysis of the amendment of two Canadian forest soils (a Brunisol from the Great LakesÁSt. Lawrence and a Luvisol from the Carolinian forest regions of Ontario) with six different wood ashes collected from different biomass boilers through short-term controlled incubations. We show that following an 8-wk incubation period, amendment of the soils with wood ash led to small to moderate increases in soil pH, but had little effect on soil microbial activity and biomass. The concentration of important base cations such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as well as phosphorus generally increased in both soil types following amendment with different ash. This practice can return nutrients lost from forest ecosystems during harvesting; however, effects were found to be boiler-specific. Lastly, we show that four ash types led to small increases in cadmium in either soil; the concentration of all other measured heavy metals was not significantly increased following amendment, and in certain cases decreased, particularly with lead. The only potentially negative aspect encountered was elevated sodium, particularly with ash from one boiler, but unacceptable Na-absorptivity ratios were not exceeded. These results demonstrate that with proper characterization and selection of wood ash type and application rates, amendment of Canadian forest soils with wood ash may benefit forest ecosystems and is unlikely to disrupt the chemical and biological processes in soil environments.",

Spatial distribution of biomass, necromass and morphology parameters of the ﬁne roots (diameter classes <1, 1–2, <2 mm) of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were analysed in response to fertilisation with granulated wood ash (GWA) in a long-term ﬁeld experiment in SW Sweden. GWA was applied as a single dose of 3200 kg haÀ1 and the ﬁne roots were sampled 9 years later by soil coring. Soil cores were divided into 1-cm strata within the top 0–2.5 cm humus limits, the lower humus below 2.5 cm (with varying thickness) and the mineral soil to 50 cm depth (from ground surface). Total ﬁne-root biomass in the control (C) and GWA treatment, 256 Æ 20 and 258 Æ 25 g mÀ2, respectively, and length 2072 Æ 182 and 1800 Æ 198 m mÀ2, respectively, did not differ statistically from each other. Total ﬁne-root necromass in the 1–2 mm fraction was signiﬁcantly higher in C than in the GWA treatment, 130 Æ 12 and 80 Æ 10 g mÀ2, respectively. Fine-root biomass in the <1 mm fraction was signiﬁcantly greater in the lower humus in the GWA treatment, but this did not affect the total biomass in the <1 mm fraction in the whole soil proﬁle. The biomass-to-necromass ratio (1–2 mm) was signiﬁcantly higher in the GWA treatment in the 0–30 cm soil layer than in the corresponding layer of the control. Speciﬁc root length (SRL) was lower in the GWA treatment than in the control in the 0–5 cm soil layer. The lower necromass and SRL were more clearly related to the GWA treatment, whereas the difference in the vertical distribution of biomass may have been related to the thicker humus layer in the GWA plots.",

		"abstract": "Liming and wood-ash addition have long been used to attenuate the effects of acidic deposition on forest soils with the goal of promoting tree growth. We performed quantitative meta-analyses of treatment studies from managed forest ecosystems to assess general tendencies of effects of treatment on seven selected measures of performance thought to reasonably reﬂect the effects of Ca-addition treatment. We retrieved over 350 independent trials from 110 peer-reviewed liming and wood-ash addition studies that were integrated to determine soil pH, base saturation (BS), tree foliar Ca concentration, tree growth, ectomychorrhizae root colonization, soil C-to-N ratio, and microbial indices. The results were quantiﬁed through three separate metaanalysis effect size metrics: unweighted relative values and two weighted metrics, Hedges' d and ln R. A surprising number of treatment trials (22%–85%) reported no signiﬁcant effect, and soil pH and foliar Ca appeared more responsive to liming than to wood-ash addition, whereas BS and tree growth appeared more responsive to wood-ash addition. For six of the seven parameters, estimated mean effect sizes were similar in magnitude and positive in direction for all three meta-analysis metrics. Regression tree optimal models explained 38% of the variation in pH, 47% of the variation in BS, 51% of the variation in foliar Ca concentration, and 26% of the variation in tree growth. The largest predictors of effect size, within our selected group, were as follows: soil type for pH; soil type, trial duration in years, and species (hardwood or softwood) for BS; treatment dose and type for foliar Ca concentration; and trial duration, initial soil pH, and tree species for tree growth. This analysis shows that Ca additions are not universally beneﬁcial and provides insight into when Ca additions to forest soils are likely to be most effective.",

		"abstract": "Production of wood ash has increased strongly in the last ten years due to the increasing popularity of renewable and CO2-neutral heat and energy production via wood burning. Wood ashes are rich in many essential plant nutrients. In addition they are alkaline. The idea of using the waste ash as fertiliser in forests is appealing. However, wood is also known for its ability to strongly enrich certain heavy metals from the underlying soils, e.g. Cd, without any anthropogenic input. Concentrations of 26 chemical elements (Ag, As, Au, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) in 40 samples each of birch and spruce wood ashes collected along a 120 km long transect in southern Norway are reported. The observed maximum concentrations are 1.3 wt.% Pb, 4.4 wt.% Zn and 203 mg/kg Cd in birch wood ashes. Wood ashes can thus contain very high heavy metal concentrations. Spreading wood ashes in a forest is a major anthropogenic interference with the natural biogeochemical cycles. As with the use of sewage sludge in agriculture the use of wood ashes in forests clearly needs regulation.",

		"abstract": "Purpose This work aimed to study the effect of the application of biomass fly ash in the soil profile and percolate water, which is a novel feature. The results produced by this work pose a useful contribute for by-products’ valorization for the pulp and paper industry, namely fly ash and sludge, diverting them from landfills and achieving significant savings. Materials and methods Soil profiles (0.60 m) were collected in the field and into laboratory-scale vessels. Four soil profiles were used in this work. One of the profiles was used as control. To each of the other three, 7.5 Mg ha−1 of biomass fly ash, fly ash combined with sludge (50:50%wt.), or a conventional liming agent (CaO) were added. A simulation of the daily natural watering of the soils has been made throughout 1 month, with collection of the daily percolating from the bottom of the vessels. After this period, soil profiles were divided into three equal-sized depth layers (0.20 m each). Soil pH, electrical conductivity, and available Ca, Mg, K, P, Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu contents were determined in the three layers for each of the four soil profiles used. A parallel experiment was conducted in which additional pots of soil were prepared with the same amendment. Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was sown in order to evaluate the effect on biomass growth and possible phytotoxicity.\nResults and discussion Amendment with biomass fly ash elevated soil pH slightly, to values within the most adequate range for plant growth. Results showed small raises in the availability of the essential plant macronutrients Ca, K, and Mg, especially in the top layer of the soils, where the amendment materials were applied. The mobilization of cations to the groundwater was always minimal, which is promising since it means little contamination to the groundwater. Ash and ash + sludge amendments produced similar plant growth results when compared to the control. However, biomass grown in Cao-amended pots showed the higher root size.\nConclusions Incorporation in the soil proved to be a viable way to manage fly ash and sludge from pulp and paper industry, which could mean considerable savings. The effect on soil fertilization was similar to the conventional liming agent. No obvious hazardous effect on the soil or groundwater was found.",

		"abstract": "Wood-ash applications have been proposed to promote the long-term sustainability of forest production at increased harvest intensities. Effects of wood-ash and nitrogen (N) application on soil-solution chemistry were studied for 9 years following application in a coniferous stand in Sweden. Crushed, self-hardened wood ash was applied at 3, 6, and 9 Mg·ha–1 alone, the lowest dosage both with and without 150 kg N·ha–1. Pelleted wood ash (3 Mg·ha–1) and N were also applied alone. The soil solution was sampled by suction cups at 50 cm depth. The crushed, self-hardened ash readily dissolved in water, as reflected in increased soil-solution concentrations of sodium and sulphate. Significant (p < 0.05) elevations were also found for potassium, calcium, aluminum, and total organic carbon. Vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, and lead were not significantly affected by the ash treatments, but cadmium tended to increase in the treatments with ash alone. From the fourth year onwards, the pH of the soil solution was lowered and the aluminum concentration raised in the plots given 9 Mg crushed ash·ha–1. Fertilization with N alone temporarily increased concentrations of inorganic N, cadmium, aluminum, and zinc and decreased the pH. The crushed ash generally had longer lasting effects than N fertilization.",

		"abstract": "The availability of phosphorus and potassium often limit growth of trees on well drained peatlands in the boreal region. Wood ash, which contains phosphorus and potassium, can be used for forest fertilization on peatlands or for nutrient compensation following intensive harvesting. This study was performed in order to investigate the effects on water chemistry of applying wood ash to a Pinus sylvestris L. stand on a drained peatland in southern Sweden. Runoff chemistry was monitored in the main ditch for one year before and three years after the application of self-hardened and crushed wood ash, applied at an average rate of 3.1×103 kg per hectare. In addition, groundwater was collected from the ash-treated peatland and from an adjacent reference peatland and chemically analysed. Shortly after woodash application, the concentrations of boron, calcium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese and sulphate in the ditch water, and the electrical conductivity, all increased. Some variables showed elevated concentrations for a few months only, while pH and the concentrations of boron, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, total phosphorus and silica were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) elevated over the last one and a half or two years of the study, compared to the reference period. The concentrations of iron, total sulphur and sulphate were lower during the last one and a half or two study years than in the reference period. Several trace metals and anions did not appear to be affected. In general, the effects detected in groundwater were consistent with those found in ditch water. Groundwater ﬂow through superﬁcial soil layers seems to have facilitated leaching.",

		"abstract": "In the future it may become common practice to return wood-ash to forest ecosystems in order to replenish nutrients removed when brash has been extracted as a source of bioenergy. Wood-ash contains most of the nutrients that are present in the brash before its removal and burning, with the important exception of nitrogen (N). In the present paper we report measurements of CO2 emissions and net N mineralisation in the humus layer and the upper 5 cm of mineral soil 12 years after the application of wood-ash to two study sites, representing different tree species, climatic conditions and N deposition histories. We hypothesized that application of wood-ash would increase both carbon (C) and net N mineralisation rates at Torup, an N-rich site with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in the south, whereas the net N mineralisation rates would not be affected at Vindeln, an N-poor site with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the north, where a possible N-limitation would restrict any N mineralisation. The treatments, comprising additions of 0, 1, 3 or 6 Mg of granulated wood-ash ha−1, were applied in a randomised block design, replicated three times. Wood-ash from the same batch was used for all treatments at both sites. All factors were measured under laboratory conditions with controlled temperature and moisture levels. The potential CO2 emissions (kg ha−1 year−1 of CO2–C) at Torup were signiﬁcantly higher in the 3 and 6 Mg ha−1 treatments than in the control treatment, and the highest application resulted in an extra loss of 0.5 Mg ha−1 of soil C annually as compared to the control. No such differences were detected at Vindeln. The results suggest that wood-ash application can deplete soil organic C at locations with similar characteristics (N-rich soil, spruce dominated, warm climate) as at Torup in this study.",

		"abstract": "Zusammenfassung Addition of wood ash to acid soils will affect the soil chemistry of forests in a number of ways which were assessed for a pine stand in northern Germany. A field experiment was carried out in a fifty-year old pine stand on a sandy Podzol at Fuhrberg (Lüneburger Heide, Lower Saxony/Germany) which involved depositing wood ash (2.4 t ha±1) on the surface. Soil solution chemistry was investigated monthly at different depths for 24 months. Prior to and 19 months after the ash addition, exchangeable cations and amounts of heavy metals were determined at different depths. Two to four months after addition of wood ash, maximum mean concentrations in the soil solution of Ca were 240 mmol l±1 at 0 cm (surface of mineral soil) and 100 mmol l±1 at 100 cm and of K 980 mmol l±1 and 140 mmol l±1, respectively. The pH values in soil solutions dropped temporarily by 0.3 units at 0 and 10 cm depth. Nitrate concentrations increased at all depths and maximum mean concentration was 230 mmol l±1 at 100 cm. Concentrations of Pb and Cr in soil solution did not change significantly (p < 0.05) after ash addition. Concentrations of Cd and Zn increased significantly at some depths but stayed well below the legal limit for drinking water and below the limits given by the German recommendation for soil conservation. Nineteen months after ash addition, the cation exchange capacity (corrected for the release of cations from the ash) of the upper 6 cm of the organic layer was almost doubled and amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg increased significantly in the upper 8 cm of the organic layer. Amounts of Zn were increased in the entire organic layer, but changes were significant only in the upper 4 cm. The results of this study suggest that ash from untreated wood (using modest additions) may be recommended for amelioration of forest soils.",

		"abstract": "Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to ﬁll this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net efﬂuxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the ﬁrst ﬁve to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.",

The treatments were an unfertilized control, a nitrogen treatment (N) and a combined treatment with N and three different doses of wood ash: 1, 2.5 and 5 Mg ash haÀ1 (WA1 + N, WA2.5 + N and WA5 + N). There were six replications in the control and N treatment and two replications in each ash + N treatment. The amount of N applied was 185 kg haÀ1. Compared to the control, the WA5 + N treatment signiﬁcantly increased the pH (0.5 pH units) and decreased the exchangeable acidity in soil (45%). The concentrations of exchangeable Ca, K and Mg in the soil in the WA2.5 + N and WA5 + N treatments and those of extractable P in all the wood ash + N treatments were signiﬁcantly higher than in the control and N-alone treatment. The Ca concentrations in the WA2.5 + N were two times and in the WA5 + N treatment three times that in the control treatment. The mean increment in basal area of the tree stand was signiﬁcantly higher in the WA1 + N and WA2.5 + N treatments than in the control or N-alone treatment during the 30-year study period. Although application of wood ash increased the growth response to N, at the end of the study period the response had virtually stopped. To compare the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences in microbial biomass and activities between different treatments, all six WA + N plots were combined, regardless of the different ash doses. Amounts of C and N in the microbial biomass, the rate of C mineralization (CO2 production) and concentration of K2SO4-extractable dissolved organic carbon were all higher in the WA + N treatment than in the N-alone treatment. The rate of net N mineralization, and the ratios between net N mineralization and C mineralization and between net N mineralization and microbial biomass N were all highest in the WA + N treatment, indicating better availability of N. In all treatments, however, both the rate of net nitriﬁcation and the NO3–N concentrations were negligible. In conclusion, wood ash application together with N seems to have very long-term effects on soil chemical properties and microbial processes in C and N cycling which give at least some explanations for the response in tree growth to this treatment.",

In Experiments 407 and 251 the responses of soil chemical properties and soil microbiological processes related to C and N cycling were also studied. The upland experiments included a control and a treatment with 3 Mg haÀ1 of wood ash. In Exp. 407, 120 kg N haÀ1 was applied together with ash; this experiment also included a treatment with N alone. The peatland experiment included a control and a treatment with 4.8 Mg haÀ1 of wood ash. All experiments had 3 replications. Wood ash signiﬁcantly decreased soil acidity on all sites. On the upland site, after 20 years, the concentration of K2SO4-extractable DOC and the rates of C mineralization (CO2–C production) and net N mineralization were all higher in the Ash + N treatment than in the control or N treatments. However, the treatments did not signiﬁcantly affect the amounts of C or N in the microbial biomass or the concentration of NH4–N. On the peatland site, after 27 years, ash stimulated C mineralization and cellulose decomposition, but microbial biomass C or N, net N mineralization or the concentration of N were not affected signiﬁcantly. On both the upland and peatland site, net nitriﬁcation was very low in all treatments. In Exp. 408, the volume growth in the control and Ash treatment was during the 20-year study period 60 and 64 m3 haÀ1, respectively, and in Exp. 402 108 and 120 m3 haÀ1, respectively, the latter difference being signiﬁcant. In Exp. 407, the volume growth in the Ash + N treatment was during the 20-year study period signiﬁcantly higher (92 m3 haÀ1) than in the N and control treatments (76 and 73 m3 haÀ1, respectively). On the peatland site during the 25-year study period the growth was 145 and 169 m3 haÀ1, in the control and Ash treatments, respectively. In conclusion, the long-term positive response of stem growth to wood ash on peatlands and N fertilized upland sites can be partly explained by changes in soil nutrient status and by microbial processes related to C and N cycling.",

Ca and Mg had intermediate solubility while P was less soluble in both water and acetic acid. The amount of hazardous substances having leached was low for most, but not all the ashes, in terms of Pb, Cr and As. Nevertheless, the phytoavailability of these hazardous substances after their application to the forest appeared low, due to their amphoteric leaching behavior and the acidity of Japanese forest soils.",

The seed and foliar samples for chemical analyses were collected during winters 1985–86 and 1988–89 from 39 grafts per clone fertilized in spring 1986. There were 6 clones and 13 treatments for each clone with three replications. The treatments consisted of N, P, K in various combinations, micronutrients, wood ash and grass control. Macro(N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, B) were analysed. There were statistically significant differences between the clones in seed nutrient concentrations. The variation of the K, Mg, Ca, Zn and Cu concentrations between the two study years was considerably larger in the seeds than in the needles. The concentrations of these elements in the seeds were low in the year of an abundant seed crop in spite of fertilization. This had, however, no negative effects on germination of seeds. The proportions of crude fat and crude protein were high in both years (34 % and 35 % in 1985 ; 33 % and 38 % in 1988). Fertilization had only minor or no effect at all on the seed chemical composition in the orchard with a satisfactory nutrient status of the soil. Also on the foliar nutrient concentrations the effect of the clone was stronger than that of fertilization. Grafts with large needles produced heavy seeds, which had more storage proteins than the lighter seeds.",

		"abstract": "The use of landfills as a disposal method for wood ash is costly, environmentally detrimental and is pitted against increasingly stern environmental regulations. Literature has shown that wood ash has the potential to be used as a forest fertiliser and the effects tend to be highly site-specific. Wood ash contains a combination of carbonates, hydroxides and other calcium-containing minerals that are responsible for the liming effect observed following application to soils. In addition, it contains significant magnesium and potassium concentrations, but little nitrogen and sulphur. The phosphorus availability of wood ash varies considerably and in effect can limit soil phosphorus uptake and may affect subsequent nutrient balance in plants. Short-rotation forestry practices and whole-tree harvest systems can induce periodic or persisting nutrient deficiencies and acidify the soil. This may affect the ability of a site to sustain adequate nutrient levels over successive rotations. Utilising wood ash as a soil amendment can offset or correct some nutrient deficiencies and imbalances induced by intensively managed plantation forests. This review covers the international literature on ash applications to forest land, including the effect of ash-beds remaining after slash burning (as a useful analogy for the effects of wood ash on soil properties and tree growth). The results show that ash applications to forest land can be done safely and can potentially stimulate microbial activity and improve pine and eucalypt growth. Safe ash application rates should be determined after consideration of (1) soil buffer capacity and ash alkalinity (expressed as calcium carbonate equivalence) and (2) an evaluation of the concentrations of heavy metals existing in soils and present in the available ash, particularly from cadmium, chromium, lead and arsenic.",

		"abstract": "A field trial was established to test the effects of various wood ash and fertilizer application rates on the nutrition and early growth of a clonal Eucalyptus grandis × urophylla stand near Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The trial consisted of wood ash treatments of 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 t ha-1, combined with fertilizer treatments of no fertilizer (control), 150 g tree-1 of conventional ammonium sulphate fertilizer or 320 g tree-1 of controlled release fertilizer mixture containing N, P and a balanced suite of several plant nutrients. The experiment was conducted on a young sandy soil of aeolian origin with a very low buffer capacity. Ash application rates were chosen after a pilot study was conducted to test the effect of CaCO3 on the soil reaction. At 4 and 8 months after treatment, soil heavy metal concentrations for cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) levels were substantially lower than toxic levels. Foliar heavy metal concentrations (for the same elements) were less than 1mg kg-1 at both time intervals. The wood ash induced a temporary liming effect up to 8 months after application. Foliar nutrient assessments revealed sub-optimal nutrient concentrations for phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) at 4 months and K at 8 months of age. The positive growth responses (expressed as a biomass index) at 8 months, ranged between 13% and 683% relative to the untreated control. At 21 months, the growth response to ash and fertilizer combinations ranged from -0.5% to 50% relative to the control. This research demonstrated that 1.2 t ha-1 of wood ash can safely be disposed of on a typical, poorly buffered Zululand coastal sand with little environmental risk and minimal growth suppression, provided that it is balanced with an appropriate NPS plus trace element fertilizer mixture.",

J. Plant Sci. 93: 1209Á1216. Wood ash has the potential to enhance productivity in agricultural systems by influencing soil pH and nutrient availability. The liming properties and fertility values of wood ash from three Atlantic wood ash sources were evaluated in this study. The liming properties were tested using three wood ash sources [JD Irving (IR), New Page (NP), and Brooklyn Power (BP)] and two local lime sources in an 8-mo incubation experiment at 258C. Soil pH was measured 14 times during the incubation. Availability of potassium (K) in wood ash was evaluated in a greenhouse setting with a K-deficient soil using annual ryegrass as the test plant. Total plant K and P uptake and Mehlich-3 extractable K and P were used as predictors of nutrient bioavailability. Wood ash application increased soil pH to the maximum level within the first 50 d after application and stabilized soil pH for 8 mo. The measured effective calcium carbonate equivalent of ashes relative to Mosher lime average among two soils were in order of BP (32) !IR (25)!NP (16). About 96, 38, and 71% of total K in IR, NP and BP ash sources, respectively, were bioavailable for ryegrass in 115 d. Although soil was not P deficient, soil P bioavailability (Mehlich III extractable P) was enhanced by 14 and 48% in NP and BP wood ash treatments, respectively, whereas P bioavailability decreased by 24% in the IR ash treatment. The results clearly demonstrate that these sources of wood ash can be considered as an effective liming agent and source of K in agricultural production systems.",

A randomized block design was used. Tree growth and concentrations of various elements in the needles were measured. The addition of similar doses of P (approx. 40 kg P ha–1) from different sources resulted in similar growth responses, amounting to 1.6–1.9 m3 ha–1 yr–1 of stem wood over the 26-year study. The P source was either wood ash (2500 kg d.w. ha–1) or PK-fertilizer (raw phosphate and potassium chloride). In response to several treatments there were both increased numbers of trees and increased growth of individual trees. The high PK-dose (40 kg P ha–1 and 80 kg K ha–1) appeared to result in a larger growth increase than the low dose (20 kg P ha–1 and 40 kg K ha–1). The N treatment had no additional effect on growth. In the control plots, tree growth was more or less negligible (0.04 m3 ha–1 yr–1). After almost 26 years, concentrations of P and K in the needles of treated plants were still higher than in the untreated control plants. Nevertheless, in spite of the elevated P concentration, P appears to limit the growth of Scots pine. In conclusion, after sufficient drainage of this type of peatland site, it is possible for a forest stand to develop to the pole stage if wood ash or PK-fertilizer is applied.",

		"abstract": "Growing quantities of biomass ashes are currently produced worldwide due to the increasing consumption of biomass in energy applications. The disposal of biomass ash in landﬁlls is costly and leads to the loss of valuable resources. Biomass ash has important macro-nutrient contents and relevant soil liming capacity, and can be recycled to soils, thus contributing to biomass-to-energy process integration and a sustainable energy production. Although the EU Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection has highlighted the importance of promoting soil amelioration through nutrient recycling and some Member States have already recognised biomass-ash value in a context of circular economy, recycling of this material at the EU level and the potential use of ash-based material in fertilisers is still not properly framed by the EU regulatory framework. Adequate regulation for biomass ash from the energy sector is recognised of most importance as a driving force towards implementation of correct management and valorisation of ash as a raw material.",

A ﬁeld experiment, which included four treatments and four replicates in a completely random design, was established on an acidic, mineral soil rich in organic matter. The treatments were two different doses of ash (5 and 10 t haÀ1), a soluble NPK fertilizer 8:24:16 (N:P2O5:K2O, 200 g per plant) and an unfertilized control. The MWBA was incorporated into the soil after cutting and chopping the existing shrub vegetation and before planting. Application of the ash produced an increase in soil pH, and in the availability of P, Ca, Mg and K. The effects on soil pH and available Ca and Mg persisted for ﬁve growing seasons. The prolonged response in this study may be attributable to the effect of ash incorporation, which may have enhanced the solubility of wood ash compounds, despite the partly combusted material present in the ash. The ash improved the nutritional status, mainly in terms of Ca and Mg, and the vector analysis indicated that these elements were limiting forest production. The soluble NPK fertilizer did not produce any improvement in growth relative to the control. The concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and plant tissue were always low and did not increase signiﬁcantly after application of the wood-bark ash. The positive effect of ash application on height and diameter growth was signiﬁcant after 5 years, with similar results for both doses of ash. The improvement was attributed to the increases in Ca and Mg in soil.",

		"abstract": "Our knowledge about the effect of single-tree inﬂuence areas on the physicochemical properties of the underlying mineral soil in forest ecosystems is still limited. This restricts our ability to adequately estimate future changes in soil functioning due to forest management practices. We studied the stand scale spatial variation of different soil organic matter species investigated by 13C NMR spectroscopy, lignin phenol and neutral sugar analysis under an unmanaged mountainous high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forest in central Europe. Multivariate geostatistical approaches were applied to relate the spatial patterns of the different soil organic matter species to topographic parameters, bulk density, oxalate- and dithionite-extractable iron, pH, and the impact of tree distribution. Soil samples were taken from the mineral top soil. Generally, the stand scale distribution patterns of different soil organic matter compounds could be divided into two groups: Those compounds, which were signiﬁcantly spatially correlated with topography/altitude and those with small scale spatial pattern (range ≤ 10 m) that was closely related to tree distribution. The concentration of plant-derived soil organic matter components, such as lignin, at a given sampling point was signiﬁcantly spatially related to the distance of the nearest tree (p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, the spatial distribution of mainly microbial-derived compounds (e.g. galactose and mannose) could be attributed to the dominating impact of small-scale topography and the contribution of poorly crystalline iron oxides that were signiﬁcantly larger in the central depression of the study site compared to crest and slope positions.",

		"abstract": "The release of mineral nutrients and other species from untreated and stabilised wood ash has been investigated. Stabilisation is applied with the aim to modify the solubility of ash components and the ash particle size, i.e. to form dense ash particle agglomerates. This process induces the formation of several secondary minerals. The most important reaction is the transformation of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3 which lowers the calcium leaching rate signi®cantly. A signi®cant fraction of the alkali metals, K and Na, is present in salts which are rapidly released. The short-term release of these salts, as simulated in laboratory experiments, was not reduced by the stabilisation methods applied. Generally, low leaching rates were observed for the important plant nutrients P and Mg as well as for Fe and other metals from both untreated and agglomerated ashes. Thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the hardening process showed that in addition to the transformation of Ca(OH)2 to CaCO3, formation of the mineral ettringite is possible at a high pH. Experimental results have con®rmed this. As the pH in the pore solution decreases during long-term leaching ettringite will be transformed into calcium carbonate and gypsum. In accordance with the experimental results, no formation of secondary solubility controlling potassium or sodium minerals was indicated by the modelling results. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There, the ash fractions were stored under varying conditions (dry, wet, open, airtight) over 16 weeks to investigate the changes in physical and chemical properties of the ashes. The results show that the main chemical reactions during storage are the formation of Ca(OH)2 from CaO and H2O and a water uptake by poorly crystallized or amorphous phases. The ash samples showed only a rather small increase in the TIC mass fraction so the carbonatation of Ca(OH)2 with CO2 to form CaCO3 played only a minor role during the time period investigated. Other reactions like the formation of ettringite or gypsum (due to the small amount of S contained in the ashes investigated) were not observed. Regarding the leaching characteristics, the Ca leaching ratio decreases over time while the K and Na leaching ratios increase. The results regarding the water demand during storage indicate that the mass fraction of Ca in the dry material in the ashes is a suitable parameter to determine the optimum water admixing rate to facilitate aging of the ashes.",

At Hasslöv, ﬁfteen years after the addition of 8.75 ton ha−1 of dolomite, the species richness of the mycorrhizal community was unchanged. However, the liming resulted in an almost total replacement of species normally found under the site conditions, with only three morphotypes from a total of 24 distinguished being common to both the control and limed plots. At Horröd, four years after the application of 3.25 ton ha−1 crushed lime, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of species recorded. This was not a result of a reduction in root tips sampled, since there was no signiﬁcant treatment effect upon root tip abundance. Instead, it appeared that the less common species present in the control plots had been lost following liming. At the same site, the addition of 4.28 ton ha−1 of wood ash had little effect upon the mycorrhizal community as a whole, with only small changes recorded in the abundance of a small number of species. This study highlights the urgent need for additional data on the temporal and load response of ectomycorrhizal fungi to the addition of lime. This information is vital in view of the proposed widespread use of lime as a counter measure to soil acidiﬁcation.",

		"abstract": "Biochar’’, or charcoal intended for use as a soil amendment, has received great attention in recent years as a means of enhancing carbon sequestration and soil properties in agricultural systems. Here we address the potential for biochar use in the context of forest restoration, reviewing relevant experimental studies on biochar use in forest ecosystems, the properties of chars generated from wood waste material, and available data on tree growth responses to biochar. To our knowledge the earliest mention of char use as a soil amendment is actually speciﬁcally in the context of forest restoration (in the 1820s in Scotland). Wood waste biochars have an unusual set of properties that suggest their applicability in a forest restoration context: namely, high recalcitrance promoting long-lasting effects, retention of cations, anions, and water, in the soil, sorptive properties that can reduce bioavailability of a wide range of toxic materials, and relative ease of production from locally available feedstocks. A meta-analysis of recent studies on biochar responses of woody plants indicates a potential for large tree growth responses to biochar additions, with a mean 41 % increase in biomass. Responses are especially pronounced at early growth stages, and appear to be higher in boreal and tropical than in temperate systems, and in angiosperms than conifers; however, there is high variability, and ﬁeld studies are few. The properties of biochars also vary greatly depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions; while this complicates their use, it provides a means to design biochars for speciﬁc restoration situations and objectives. We conclude that there is great promise for biochar to play an important role in a wide variety of forest restoration efforts, speciﬁcally as a replacement product for other forms of organic matter and liming agents.",

		"abstract": "To assess environmental risks of wood ash, limnological effects of ash application to the drainage basins of two small, humic lakes and one reference lake in southern Finland were examined in this threeyear study. Treated areas corresponded to 12 and 19% of the total catchment and the amount of wood ash added was 6400 kg haϪ1. Immediate effects of wood ash on lake water were investigated in three tank experiments each lasting 1.5 wk. In tank experiments, addition of wood ash increased pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and Ca and P concentrations of humic lake water, while growth of phytoplankton decreased. After wood ash application to the subcatchments, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and concentrations of K؉, SO42Ϫ, and ClϪ slightly increased, both in inflowing waters and in the lakes, but no increased leaching of Ca, N, or P from the treated subcatchments occurred. Phytoplankton biomass increased in both experimental lakes in comparison with the reference lake. In the lake with 19% application rate to the catchment, zooplankton biomass also increased. The results indicate that, over the short term, a small-scale ash treatment to a forested drainage basin will not necessarily cause significant changes in the water quality of boreal humic lakes, but at higher application rates, changes in water chemistry and biology are more evident.",

		"abstract": "The effect of liming and ash treatment on pools, ﬂuxes and concentrations of major solutes was investigated at two forested sites (Norway spruce) in S. Sweden. One site was treated 15 yr prior to sampling (Hasslöv-Hs; dolomite: 3.45 and 8.75 t ha−1) and the other 4 yr before (Horröd-Hd; dolomite: 3.25 t ha−1; wood ash: 4.28 t ha−1). Effects of liming were most pronounced in the O horizon solutions where higher pH, elevated Ca (120–700 µM) and Mg (50–600 µM) were observed as compared to control plots. The impact on the mineral soil was more moderate. Soil solution concentrations were combined with modelled hydrological ﬂow to calculate mass ﬂows, which largely followed the trends of the solution composition. Liming also resulted in large increases of both exchangeable Ca and Mg as well as effective cation exchange capacity (CECE; 2–5 times the controls). The base saturation (BS%) was raised to 60–100% in the O horizon while in the mineral soil elevated values were only seen at the Hs site (20–60%; down to 10–15 cm depth for 8.75 t ha−1). Ash treatment did not affect either the soil solution nor the exchangeable pool to the same extent as lime. In general, the impact at the Hd site was less pronounced especially in the mineral soil, which might be due to shorter treatment time (4 vs. 15 yr) and also different thickness of the O horizon. Budget calculations for Ca and Mg originating from the lime showed that a major part of the Ca (40–100%) was retained in the top 30 cm of the soil, of which 30–95% was present in the O horizon. The mobility of Mg was greater and it was estimated that a signiﬁcant part had been leached from the proﬁle (30 and 50 cm depth) after 15 yr. Increased mass ﬂows of NO−3 due to nitriﬁcation resulting from liming at the Hs site were calculated in the range 120–350 mmol m−2 yr−1 (or 1.2–3.5 kmol ha−1 yr−1). There was signiﬁcant leaching of Al (25–60 mmol m−2 yr−1), of which about 70% was inorganic, in the lower B horizon at both sites with no inﬂuence of liming.",

We conducted an experiment between 2002 and 2005, investigating the effects of biofuel ash and nitrogen fertilisation applied to Scots Pine stands on nutrient poor Arenosols. We studied the effects of three fertilization treatments (biofuel ash, nitrogen and ash applied together with nitrogen) on dry mass and concentrations of the main nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and other elements (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) in different compartments and layers of the canopy. The biofuel ash, nitrogen fertilizers and ash applied together with nitrogen led to heavier needles in the upper and middle layers of the canopy with less effect toward the canopy base. The complex ash plus nitrogen treatment gave the strongest significant response. All treatments resulted in an increase in dry mass, but not in the length of the current year needles. The additional input of nitrogen induced higher increase in dry mass compared to the changes of N concentration in the youngest needles. On the basis of the present study results, it can be concluded that the youngest needles produced new mass per amount of nitrogen more effectively compared to older needles.",

		"abstract": "An extended overview of the phase–mineral and chemical composition and classiﬁcation of biomass ash (BA) was conducted. Some general considerations related to the composition of BA and particularly problems associated with this issue were discussed initially. Then, reference peer-reviewed data including phase–mineral composition and properties of BAs plus own investigations were used to describe and organise the BA system. It was found that BA is a complex inorganic–organic mixture with polycomponent, heterogeneous and variable composition. The phase–mineral composition of BA includes: (1) mostly inorganic matter composed of non-crystalline (amorphous) and crystalline to semi-crystalline (mineral) constituents; (2) subordinately organic matter consisting of char and organic minerals; and (3) some ﬂuid matter comprising moisture and gas and gas–liquid inclusions associated with both inorganic and organic matter. Approximately 229 forming, major, minor or accessory phases or minerals were identiﬁed in BA. These species have primary, secondary or tertiary origin in the combustion residue and they are generated from natural (authigenic and detrital) and technogenic phases or minerals originally present in biomass. Common topics related to BA such as: terminology clariﬁcation; chemical composition; contents and concentration trends; correlations and associations; formation and behaviour; fusion temperatures; and leaching; were discussed and compared to coal ash. A general characterization of the phase–mineral composition and description of the occurrence and origin for common constituents in BA, namely: (1) silicates; (2) oxides and hydroxides; (3) sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and thiosulphates); (4) phosphates; (5) carbonates (plus bicarbonates); (6) chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates); (7) nitrates; (8) glass; (9) other inorganic phases; (10) organic phases; and (11) organic minerals; were also conducted and compared to coal ash. Finally, certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identiﬁed in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, glass and some silicates and carbonates). It was found that these systematic associations in BA have a key importance in both fundamental and applied aspects, namely their potential application for classiﬁcation and indicator purposes connected with innovative and sustainable processing of BA. The potential utilization, technological and environmental advantages and challenges related to BA using the above classiﬁcation approach are described in Part 2 of the present work.",

		"abstract": "Ash from combustion of biofuels, for example wood chips, is often deposited as waste, but due to its high content of essential plant nutrients and alkalinity, it has been proposed to recycle ash as a fertilizer and liming agent in biofuel production forest. However, current legislation sets rather strict limitations for wood-ash application in biofuel production systems. The soil microfood web, that is microorganisms and their microfaunal grazers, protozoa and nematodes, is pivotal for essential ecosystem processes such as decomposition and plant nutrient release. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the impacts on microfood web structure and functioning must precede actions towards raising the currently allowed application rates. In a Danish Norway spruce plantation, we evaluate the impact of wood ash applied at dosages from 0 to the extreme case of 90 t ash haÀ1 on the microfood web, the bacterial community structure, soil content of inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled the direct effect of the disturbance imposed by ash per se, the associated pH increase and changes in prey abundance on individual organism groups in the microfood web. The SEM showed that the pH rise was the main driver of increasing abundances of culturable heterotrophic bacteria with increasing ash doses, and via trophical transfer, this also manifested as higher abundances of bacterial grazers. Fungal-feeding nematodes were unaffected by ash, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous nematodes decreased due to the direct effect of ash. Increasing ash doses enhanced the difference between bacterial communities of control plots and ash-amended plots. The ashinduced stimulation of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and bacterial grazers increased inorganic nitrogen availability at ash doses of 9 t haÀ1 and above. Hence, raised limits for ash application may potentially beneﬁt tree growth via enhanced N mineralization activity of the soil food web.",

The study was based on ﬁeld experiments carried out on two mires in Finland in 1997e1998. Two different types of wood ash were applied at dosages of 3500, 3700, 10 500 and 11 100 kg haÀ1.

Wood ash application resulted in increased leachate pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and electrical conductivity (EC). Increasing application of wood ash increased cumulative release of inorganic carbon (IC), chloride (Cl), nitrate (NO3), sulfate (SO4), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), phosphorus (P), and copper (Cu). Release of NO3, P, iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), Cu, and lead (Pb) continued. Large amounts of DOC, K, Ca, and SO4 were mobilized. Inorganic C, Fe, and Mg were released in moderate quantities. Manganese, Na, Al, Cl, and NO3 were released in limited amounts. Amounts of leached P, Pb, and Cu were lower. The mixed order equation adequately described the release of elements in the soilash mixture. Accumulation of elevated amounts of trace elements does not appear to be a problem when higher wood ash rates are avoided. Wood ash should be applied in split application to avoid short-term concentrated alkaline and salty conditions that could interfere with plant growth.",

		"abstract": "Food-web structure mediates dramatic effects of biodiversity loss including secondary and ‘cascading’ extinctions. We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience ‘rivet-like’ thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These ﬁndings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.",

Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet, species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            Core microbes were defined as those present in >30% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1,411 strong and mostly positive (∼95%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria, while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter, which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season, particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and may represent transitions between seasonal communities.\n          \n          \n            Conclusions\n            We found a relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes toth e understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly sustaining ocean ecosystem function.",

		"abstract": "Human microbiome studies are increasingly incorporating macroecological approaches, such as community assembly, network analysis and functional redundancy to more fully characterize the microbiome. Such analyses have not been applied to ancient human microbiomes, preventing insights into human microbiome evolution. We address this issue by analysing published ancient microbiome datasets: coprolites from Rio Zape (\n              n\n              = 7; 700 CE Mexico) and historic dental calculus (\n              n\n              = 44; 1770–1855 CE, UK), as well as two novel dental calculus datasets: Maya (\n              n\n              = 7; 170 BCE-885 CE, Belize) and Nuragic Sardinians (\n              n\n              = 11; 1400–850 BCE, Italy). Periodontitis-associated bacteria (\n              Treponema denticola\n              ,\n              Fusobacterium nucleatum\n              and\n              Eubacterium saphenum\n              ) were identified as keystone taxa in the dental calculus datasets. Coprolite keystone taxa included known short-chain fatty acid producers (\n              Eubacterium biforme, Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens\n              ) and potentially disease-associated bacteria (\n              Escherichia\n              ,\n              Brachyspira)\n              . Overlap in ecological profiles between ancient and modern microbiomes was indicated by similarity in functional response diversity profiles between contemporary hunter–gatherers and ancient coprolites, as well as parallels between ancient Maya, historic UK, and modern Spanish dental calculus; however, the ancient Nuragic dental calculus shows a distinct ecological structure. We detected key ecological signatures from ancient microbiome data, paving the way to expand understanding of human microbiome evolution.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Insights into health and disease from ancient biomolecules’.",

		"abstract": "The use of wood ash in forestry has been questioned because the cadmium (Cd) concentration of ash, which varies between 1 and 20 mg kg−1 ash, exceeds the level allowed for fertilizers (3 mg kg−1) used in agriculture. To investigate the combined and separated effects of Cd and ash on the forest humus microflora, pumice or wood ash, spiked with a water-soluble (CdCl2) or -insoluble (CdO) form of Cd at three levels (0, 400 and 1000 mg kg−1), were applied at a fertilization level of 5000 kg ha−1 in a laboratory microcosm study. The trial consisted of 60 microcosms (five replications per treatment), which were incubated in darkness at +20°C and a constant relative air humidity of 60%. After two months the humus in the microcosms was sampled. Analyses of CO2 evolution to measure the overall microbial activity and of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern to measure microbial community structure were performed. The substrate-use patterns of Biolog EcoPlates were analyzed as a measure of bacterial functionality. Finally the bacterial 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of different concentrations of Cd and the number of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria on nutrient agar in the presence of 0, 5 and 20 mg Cd l−1 agar were applied to measure Cd tolerance. The use of pumice (pH of humus under the pumice 4.0) did not induce any changes in the above variables compared to two untreated microcosms (humus pH 3.9). Pumice was therefore used to distribute the Cd evenly over the humus surface in order to estimate the possible effect of Cd without ash (pH of humus under the ash 7.0). The application of ash increased the microbial activity, changed the PLFA and substrate-use patterns and increased cfu compared to the humus under pumice. The form and level of Cd in the ash had no further effect on this result. In the humus under pumice the level, but not the form of Cd decreased the microbial activity and changed the PLFA pattern compared to the unspiked pumice. None of the treatments induced bacterial tolerance to Cd. Ash thus protected the humus microflora from the harmful effects of Cd.",

We conclude that there were no negative effects of applying either wood ash and that application of ash at 10 000 kg·ha−1, particularly with the low-carbon ash, produced the greatest changes. We anticipate that changes may become more evident over the longer term, especially with respect to tree growth and nutritional responses (e.g., as nutrient uptake demand increases) once the seedlings become more established.",

		"abstract": "Here we have investigated the effects of the addition of two different wood ash sizes at two different doses (5 and 20t/ha) on the physico-chemical, microbiological and biochemical properties in the surface soil (0–30cm) of an Italian agricultural system. Over 24 months, the pH, electrical conductivity, soil microbial biomass-C and -N, and total hydrolytic activity were periodically tested, together with alkaline phosphatase, arylsulphatase and o-diphenoloxidase activities. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to consider the effects of sampling time and wood ash addition on the parameters tested and to reveal possible interactions between the two variables. For electrical conductivity, pH, soil microbial biomass-C and total hydrolytic activity the ANOVA showed a significant ‘wood ash type× sampling time’ interaction, while no interaction was found for the other enzymatic activities. Significant increases in pH and in electrical conductivity were seen over the first months in all of the treated samples, which were more pronounced at the higher dose. Decreases in microbial biomass-C and changes in the microbial C/N ratios were seen for all of the treatments, which were more pronounced at the higher dose. Increases in soil microbial activity were seen over the first 8 months. The alkaline phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities were significantly inhibited for the first 4 months of soil treatment. The significant increases seen in o-diphenoloxidase activity over the first 8 months under all of the treatments appear to be related to the increases in electrical conductivity. After 12 months, the levels of all of the parameters tested in the treated soils returned to the levels of the untreated soils indicating that the disposal of up to 20t/ha of wood ash per year in Italian agricultural soil does not result in long-term changes in any of these parameters.",

		"abstract": "In boreal forests of eastern Canada, wildfire has gradually been replaced by clearcut harvesting as the most extensive form of disturbance. Such a shift in disturbance may influence the chemical properties of the forest floor and its capacity to cycle and supply nutrients, with possible implications for forest productivity. We compared the effects of stem-only harvesting (SOH), whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and wildfire on the chemical composition of forest floor organic matter and nutrient availability for plants, 15–20 years after disturbance in boreal coniferous stands in Quebec (Canada). The forest floor on plots of wildfire origin was significantly enriched in aromatic forms of C with low solubility, whereas the forest floor from SOH and WTH plots was enriched with more soluble and labile C compounds. The forest floor of wildfire plots was also characterized by higher N concentration, but its high C:N and high concentration of 15N suggest that its N content could be recalcitrant and have a slow turnover rate. Total and exchangeable K were associated with easily degradable organic structures, whereas total and exchangeable Ca and Mg were positively correlated with the more recalcitrant forms of C. We suggest that the bulk of Ca and Mg cycling in the soil–plant system is inherited from the influx of exchangeable cations in the forest floor following disturbance. The buildup of Ca and Mg exchangeable reserves should be greater with wildfire than with harvesting, due to the sudden pulse of cation-rich ash and to the deposition of charred materials with high exchange capacity. This raises uncertainties about the long-term availability of Ca and Mg for plant uptake on harvested sites. In contrast, K availability should not be compromised by either harvesting or wildfire since it could be recycled rapidly through vegetation, litter and labile organic compounds.",

		"abstract": "Tetracycline antibiotics (TA) used in veterinary medicine reach terrestrial ecosystems mostly via the repeated applications of animal manures and slurries on agricultural soils, where they may cause toxic effects on bacterial communities. In the current work, we studied the efficacy of adding doses of 0, 6, 24 and 48 g kg−1 of biomass ash (BA) to four different soils to reduce potential negative effects of tetracycline antibiotics. Specifically, soil samples were polluted with different concentrations of tetracycline, oxytetracycline or chlortetracycline, and the bacterial community growth was estimated using the 3H leucine incorporation technique. Soil amendment with BA increased soil pH (1.3–4.8 units), total carbon (0.7–5.8 g kg−1) and Fe and Al oxides concentrations (0.25–3.98 g kg−1), as well as bacterial activity (1–9 times compared to the control). In addition, BA amendment at high doses (24 or 48 g kg−1) resulted in a similar toxicity decrease for the three antibiotics, but with variations among soils. The reductions in antibiotics toxicity were very variable, ranging between 5% and 100% (total recovery). In view of that, the spreading of BA could be interesting as management practice to reduce risks of soil pollution and subsequent toxicity on bacterial communities due to tetracycline antibiotics.",

However, wood ash amendment affects soil physicochemical parameters that control composition and functional expression of the soil microbial community. Here, we applied total RNA sequencing to simultaneously assess the impact of wood ash amendment on the active soil microbial communities and the expression of functional genes from all microbial taxa. Wood ash significantly affected the taxonomic (rRNA) as well as functional (mRNA) profiles of both agricultural and forest soil. Increase in pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved organic carbon and phosphate were the most important physicochemical drivers for the observed changes. Wood ash amendment increased the relative abundance of the copiotrophic groups Chitinonophagaceae (Bacteroidetes) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) and resulted in higher expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell growth. Finally, total RNA sequencing allowed us to show that some groups of bacterial feeding protozoa increased concomitantly to the enhanced bacterial growth, which shows their pivotal role in the regulation of bacterial abundance in soil.",

		"abstract": "Digestate from biogas production contains a significant amount in organic matter and N, whereas fly ash from biomass combustion is rich in P and other nutrients. The use of both, as suitable fertilizers, has been shown to improve crop yields and soil properties. A Chernozem soil was used in a pot experiment in which wheat was grown to evaluate the impact of digestate (organic amendment) and fly ash (inorganic amendment) application on soil microbial activity, biomass and community structure. Soil samples were collected after two time-term treatments (30 and 60 days). Digestate application significantly improved soil chemical variables, microbial activity, the substrate average well colour development (SAWCD) and physiological diversity. Bacterial, actinobacterial, and fungal communities were positively affected by digestate addition, as well as microbial biomass. These effects were evident after a short period (30 days), but were more significant after long-term treatment (60 days). However, fly ash did not provoke significant changes in soil microbial activities, qPCR or PLFA at any time of treatment. Nevertheless, with this amendment, some chemical variables were positively affected after 60 days of treatment and the SAWCD revealed different patterns in the use of C sources compared with un-amended and digestate-amended soil at both treatment times. These results suggest that the chemical properties present in digestate may determine its use as a suitable organic amendment because it improves soil health and quality, whereas fly ash did not have a relevant impact on soil microbial activities, qPCR, or PLFA.",

Wood ash application to soil leads to strong vertical gradients in physicochemical parameters. Consequently, we designed an experimental system where small-scale vertical changes in soil properties and prokaryotic community structure could be followed after wood ash application. A mixed fly and bottom ash was applied in dosages of 3 and 9 t ha−1 to the surface of soil mesocosms, simulating a typical coniferous podzol. Soil pH, exchangeable cations and 16S prokaryotic community was subsequently assessed at small depth intervals to 5 cm depth at regular intervals for one year. Wood ash significantly changed the prokaryotic community in the top of the soil column. Also, the largest increases in pH and concentrations of exchangeable cations was found here. The relative abundance of prokaryotic groups directionally changed, suggesting that wood ash favors copiotrophic prokaryotes at the expense of oligotrophic and acidophilic taxa. The effect of wood ash were negligible both in terms of pH- and biological changes in lower soil layers. Consequently, by micro-vertical profiling we showed that wood ash causes a steep gradient of abiotic factors driving biotic changes but only in the top-most soil layers.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is produced by burning wood residues for energy and is often landfilled but can be more sustainably used as a forest soil amendment. We investigated how different fly and bottom wood ashes applied at a moderate 10 Mg∙ha−1 (dry) affected earthworms, a key group of forest soil biota. We conducted a field experiment with different wood ashes and application timings to determine the effects on population densities of different earthworm functional groups three weeks and one year post-amendment. We also used three laboratory microcosm experiments focused on the geographically widespread and ecologically influential anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to test how wood ashes affect acute survivorship as well as habitat avoidance and surface feeding behaviors. In the field, wood ash amendment generally decreased or had no impact on earthworm densities in the first three weeks following amendment (with density decreases up to − 52 m−2), but had neutral or minor positive impacts one year later (up to + 21 m−2). In the laboratory, wood ashes generally had no effects on short-term earthworm survivorship or growth, but earthworms did respond behaviorally to certain wood ashes by habitat avoidance and reduced surface activity, with decreases in the overall frequency of aboveground events (−63%), the individual duration of each event (−63%), and the percentage of events that involved contact with litter (−53%). Across all experiments, fly ash tended to have a stronger effect than bottom ash. Overall, our study suggests that while some wood ashes may have limited short-term impacts on earthworm abundances, they may cause more subtle but ecologically important behavioral changes. Additionally, these earthworm-wood ash interactions are likely influenced by highly scenario-specific circumstances, including wood ash type, application site, and timing of application.",

		"abstract": "The identification of causal links between microbial community structure and ecosystem functions are required for a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental change. One of the most influential factors affecting plants and microbial communities in soil in managed ecosystems is the current land-use. In forestry, wood ash has been proposed as a liming agent and a fertilizer, but has been questioned due to the risk associated with its Cd content. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash on the structure and function of decomposer microbial communities in forest soils and to assign them to causal mechanisms. To do this, we assessed the responses to wood ash application of (i) the microbial community size and structure, (ii) microbial community trait-distributions, including bacterial pH relationships and Cd-tolerance, to assign the microbial responses to pH and Cd, and (iii) consequences for proxies of the function soil organic matter (SOM) turnover including respiration and microbial growth rates. Two sets of field-experiments in temperate conifer forest plantations were combined with laboratory microcosm experiments where wood ash additions were compared to additions of lime and Cd. Wood ash induced structural changes in the microbial community in both field experiments, and striking similarities were observed between the application of ash and that of lime in the microcosm experiments. Wood ash increased pH, and led to a shift toward faster SOM decomposition and a reduced importance of fungi. This coincided with shifts in bacterial community trait distributions for pH, with pH optima closely tracking the new soil pH. A Cd solution could induce Cd-tolerance in the microcosm experiments, but the ash did not affect the microbial tolerance to Cd in field or microcosm experiments. We demonstrate that the microbial community responded strongly to the application of wood ash to forest soils with consequences for its functional capabilities in terms of respiration and growth rates. The bacterial community's trait distributions revealed that the increased pH directly caused the microbial responses, while the wood ash associated Cd has no detectable effects on the microbial community. The study demonstrates the power of community trait distributions to (i) causally link microbial structural responses to environmental change and (ii) potential to predict the ecosystem functional consequences.",

In addition, wood ash recycles nutrients removed at harvest to the forest ecosystem. Both liming and wood ash applications typically increase soil pH by 1–2 units. Therefore, they affect a range of soil processes and organisms including ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi which are vital for the nutrition of many tree species. Here we review field studies reporting the effects of lime and wood ash amendments on EM fungi. We systematically compiled studies where known amounts of ash or lime were distributed to plots paired with comparable control plots, and where mycorrhizal variables were recorded. For a subset of studies meeting explicit criteria, we performed meta-analyses using overall mycorrhizal abundance, species richness or the abundance of specific fungal taxa as response variables. Guided by availability of data, the focus is on Nordic coniferous forests. Although the reviewed field studies varied widely in dosage and experimental setup they clearly demonstrated that liming and wood ash amendments influence EM fungal species composition. Across studies, species belonging to the lineages Cortinarius and Russula-lactarius (Basidiomycota), particularly Russula ochroleuca, decreased in relative abundance, while species within the Tuber-helvella (Ascomycota) increased. Particular species within the Amphinema-tylospora lineage responded in opposite directions; Tylospora fibrillosa decreased in relation to the control, while Amphinema byssoides increased. The significant changes in species or clade abundances were in the range of 5–20% compared to non-treated plots. In contrast, neither the belowground mycorrhizal biomass nor species richness responded to liming or wood ash applications. We conclude that liming and wood ash amendments cause consistent EM fungal species dominance shifts, but that a high EM fungal biomass and species and phylogenetic richness is maintained on the tree roots. Given the large dispersal potential of many EM fungi, we therefore suggest that these treatments at normal recommended dosages do not pose any immediate threats to EM fungal biodiversity, at least not when applied at relatively small spatial scales. Whether the observed dominance shifts among EM fungal clades have consequences for the functioning of the EM fungal guild, e.g. in relation to nutrient cycling or tree nutrition, is an important question that should be further investigated.",

		"abstract": "Experiments with potted plants and removed understories have indicated that understory vegetation often affects the chemical and microbial properties of soil. In this study, we examined the mechanism and extent of the influence of understory vegetation on the chemical and microbial properties of soil in plantation forests. The relationships between the vegetational structure (diversity for different functional layers, aboveground biomass of understory vegetation, and species number) and soil properties (pH, microbial community structure, and levels of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and inorganic nitrogen) were analyzed across six reforestation types (three pure needleleaf forests, a needle-broadleaf mixed forest, a broadleaf forest, and a shrubland). Twenty-seven years after reforestation, soil pH significantly decreased by an average of 0.95 across reforestation types. Soil pH was positively correlated with the aboveground biomass of the understory. The levels of total, bacterial, and fungal phospholipid fatty acids, and the fungal:bacterial ratios were similar in the shrubland and the broadleaf forest. Both the aboveground biomass of the understory and the diversity of the tree layer positively influenced the fungal:bacterial ratio. Improving the aboveground biomass of the understory could alleviate soil acidification. An increase in the aboveground biomass of the understory, rather than in understory diversity, enhanced the functional traits of the soil microbial communities. The replacement of pure plantations with mixed-species stands, as well as the enhancement of understory recruitment, can improve the ecological functions of a plantation, as measured by the alleviation of soil acidification and increased fungal dominance.",

		"abstract": "It is of great importance to understand how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global changes. However, most experimental approaches have focused on single factors. In natural systems, moisture and temperature often change simultaneously, and they can interact and shape microbial responses. Even though soil moisture and temperature are very important factors controlling microbial activity, there is disagreement on the dependence of microbial rates on temperature and moisture as well as their sensitivity when both variables change simultaneously. Here we created a moisture gradient and determined high resolution intrinsic temperature dependences for bacterial and fungal growth rates as well as respiration rates. We found that microbial rates decreased with lower moisture and increased with higher temperatures until optimum values. Additionally, we found independence between temperature and moisture as rate modifiers. We also found that temperature sensitivities (Q10) for microbial growth and respiration were not affected by changes in moisture. This provided an experimental framework to validate assumptions of temperature and moisture rate modifiers used in ecosystem and global cycling models (GCMs).",

		"abstract": "The use of wood ash in forestry has been questioned because of the potential risk associated with its cadmium (Cd) content (1–30 mg kg−1). In agriculture, wood ash is only allowed for use as a fertilizer when its Cd content is below 3 mg kg−1. This restriction has not been applied to forest soils and there is a lack of knowledge about the potentially harmful effects of the Cd in wood ash on forest ecosystems. This paper summarizes our recent studies on the microbial communities of boreal coniferous forest humus exposed to Cd-containing wood ash treatment. The main objectives of our studies were to test if the Cd in wood ash has the potential to affect the humus layer microflora of coniferous upland forests and if it has the potential to enter the human food chain. These objectives were tested both in laboratory and field experiments with ash and ash spiked with Cd (in laboratory 400 or 1,000 mg Cd kg−1 as CdO or CdCl2; in field 400 mg Cd kg−1 as CdO). In one study the dissolution of ash was accelerated by irrigating it with simulated acid rain (SAR). Wood ash increased humus layer pH and microbial activities (respiration or thymidine incorporation rates) and changed its microfloral community structure (Biolog, PLFA, 16S or 18S rDNA PCR-DGGE) in both laboratory and field experiments. Spiking ash with Cd induced no further changes in the above-mentioned variables compared to ash alone. The Cd added with wood ash did not become bioavailable as detected with a bacterial biosensor Bacillus subtilis BR151(pTOO24). The form and level of Cd added in the ash had no further effect on the microbiological variables studied. Irrigation of ash with SAR did not increase the amount of bioavailable Cd, although the dissolution rate of the ash was increased. The concentration of Cd in soil water and in the berries of Vaccinium uliginosum and V. vitis-idaea, and the amount of humus bioavailable Cd did not increase with applied ash or ash spiked with Cd although the ash spiked with Cd increased the amount of humus total and extractable Cd in the 4-year field study. Only the ash spiked with Cd and not the unspiked “normal” wood ash resulted in significantly higher Cd concentrations in the mushroom Lactarius rufus and a slight increase in the berries of Empetrum nigrum (first year only). In conclusion, the Cd in wood ash did not become bioavailable and harmful to forest soil microbes, or leach into the humus layer even when treated with simulated acid rain. It is thus safe to use wood ash as a fertilizer in forests. However, since wood ash adds Cd to the environment, it is recommended that the same sites should not be fertilized with wood ash more than once. The effects of wood ash (3 t ha−1) on forest soil humus layer microbes are long-term, lasting at least 20 years, and probably longer if higher application dose and/or hardened ash is used.",

		"abstract": "Soils are a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems, and play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and the ecology of microbial, plant and animal communities. Global increases in the intensity and frequency of ecological disturbances are driving major changes in the structure and function of forest ecosystems, yet little is known about the long-term impacts of disturbance on soils. Here we show that natural disturbance (fire) and human disturbances (clearcut logging and post-fire salvage logging) can significantly alter the composition of forest soils for far longer than previously recognized. Using extensive sampling across a multi-century chronosequence in some of the tallest and most carbon-dense forests worldwide (southern Australian, mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests), we provide compelling evidence that disturbance impacts on soils are evident up to least eight decades after disturbance, and potentially much longer. Relative to long-undisturbed forest (167 years old), sites subject to multiple fires, clearcut logging or salvage logging were characterized by soils with significantly lower values of a range of ecologically important measures at multiple depths, including available phosphorus and nitrate. Disturbance impacts on soils were most pronounced on sites subject to compounding perturbations, such as multiple fires and clearcut logging. Long-lasting impacts of disturbance on soil can have major ecological and functional implications.",

		"abstract": "N-Acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase, EC 3.2.1.30) is one of three enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of chitin. This hydrolysis is important in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils because it participates in the processes whereby chitin is converted to amino sugars, which are major sources of mineralizable N in soils. This study investigated the relationship between N mineralization indexes and activity of β-glucosaminidase in soils from six agroecological zones of the North Central region of the United States. Nitrogen mineralization was studied by using short-term laboratory incubations under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and by hydrolysis of soil organic N by steam distillation with chemical reagents. Enzyme activity was assayed at its optimal pH value. The amounts of N mineralized by all the biological and chemical methods studied were significantly correlated with β-glucosaminidase activity, with r values of 0.73*** and 0.76*** for the amounts of released by steam distillation with PO4-B4O7 for 4 or 8 min, respectively; of 0.69*** and 0.74*** for the amounts of released with Na2B4O7 for 4 or 8 min, respectively; of 0.47*** for the amounts of inorganic N produced under aerobic incubation; of 0.80*** for amounts of inorganic N produced by incubation under anaerobic conditions of field-moist soils; and of 0.86*** for anaerobic incubation of air-dried soils. There was a significant correlation between β-glucosaminidase activity and organic C (r = 0.56***), total N (r = 0.60***), and fixed of the soils (r = 0.79***). The amounts of inorganic N released by the methods, with the exception of those under aerobic incubation, were significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with organic C and total N contents of the soils, with r values ranging from 0.65*** to 0.78*** and from 0.62*** to 0.80*** for organic C and total N, respectively.",

We investigated the influence of climatic and soil traits on phosphatase activity in terrestrial systems using metadata analysis from published studies. This is the first analysis of global measurements of phosphatase in natural soils. Our results suggest that organic P (Porg), rather than available P, is the most important P fraction in predicting phosphatase activity. Structural equation modeling using soil total nitrogen (TN), mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, thermal amplitude and total soil carbon as most available predictor variables explained up to 50% of the spatial variance in phosphatase activity. In this analysis, Porg could not be tested and among the rest of available variables, TN was the most important factor explaining the observed spatial gradients in phosphatase activity. On the other hand, phosphatase activity was also found to be associated with climatic conditions and soil type across different biomes worldwide. The close association among different predictors like Porg, TN and precipitation suggest that P recycling is driven by a broad scale pattern of ecosystem productivity capacity.",

The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying >30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent \"axes of variation\" shaped by markedly different processes.",

		"abstract": "Fungi typically live in highly diverse communities composed of multiple ecological guilds. Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e., saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds, another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new categories and records as well as refine those already in existence.",

		"abstract": "Soil invertebrates are known to be much involved in soil behaviour and therefore in the provision of ecosystem services. Functional trait-based approaches are methodologies which can be used to understand soil invertebrates’ responses to their environment. They (i) improve the predictions and (ii) are less dependent on space and time. The way traits have been used recently has led to misunderstandings in the integration and interpretation of data. Trait semantics are especially concerned. The aim of this paper is to propose a thesaurus for soil invertebrate trait-based approaches. T-SITA, an Internet platform, is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of traits and ecological preferences for soil invertebrates. It reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. definition) of approximately 100 traits and ecological preferences. In addition, T-SITA has been successfully linked with a fully operational database of soil invertebrate traits. Such a link enhances data integration and improves the scientific integrity of data.",

		"abstract": "Microbes, i.e. viruses, prokaryotes, protists and fungi are main players in biogeochemical cycles in aquatic and soil systems. As predators, pathogens, commensals and symbionts they are associated with multicellular life forms. Microbes show a dazzling array of biodiversity and it has been argued that due to their small size and huge numbers, microbes are distributed worldwide (‘everything is everywhere’). However, we summarize evidence that even free-living microbes have biogeographies and thus might be subject to at least local extinctions. Furthermore, some microbes do seem to be restricted to very particular environments and are endangered in as much as these environments are threatened. Finally, microbes intimately associated with other organisms share (partially) the biogeographies of their hosts. As far as they are species-specific, they could potentially become extinct along with their hosts. Overall, extinction rates typically reported are underestimates, since they do not take into account associated microorganisms which likely become extinct with the host organism, plant or animal. As multicellular species can have specific viral, prokaryotic, protistan and fungal species associated with them, extinction rates could be several times higher than assumed previously.",

		"abstract": "Distributions of species, animals or plants, terrestrial or aquatic, are inﬂuenced by numerous factors such as physical and biogeographical gradients. Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial ﬁltering technique that offers as much ﬂexibility as the Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process inﬂuencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Que´ bec.",

The long-term ecological challenges associated with maintaining soil fertility in managed forests are not yet known, in part due to the complexity of soil microbial communities and the heterogeneity of forest soils. This study determined the long-term effects of timber harvesting, accompanied by varied organic matter (OM) removal, on bacterial and fungal soil populations in 11- to 17-year-old reforested coniferous plantations at 18 sites across North America. Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the expansion of desiccation- and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa, including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention, which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers. Biogeographical differences in the distribution of taxa as well as local edaphic and environmental conditions produced substantial variation in the effects of harvesting. This extensive molecular-based investigation of forest soil advances our understanding of forest disturbance and lays the foundation for monitoring long-term impacts of timber harvesting.",

This study measured microbial community structure and function to assess the impacts of intensiﬁed biomass removal on soil from a managed northern jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forest in Ontario, Canada. Four clear-cut harvesting removal intensities were compared with uncut controls and mature, ﬁre-regenerated forest reference plots: stem-only removal, full-tree biomass removal, full-tree biomass with stump removal, and full-tree biomass with stump removal and soil blading that eliminated all aboveground and much belowground organic matter. A nearby recently burned forest site, representing common natural disturbance in the region, was also studied. Within the ﬁrst two years after harvesting, there were signiﬁcant differences in community structure and degradation of various C compounds among all harvested and unharvested sites, but little difference in communities across the different harvest intensities. Communities within the ﬁre site were not comparable with those of harvested treatments, indicating that clear-cut logging may not initially produce an ecologically comparable disturbance with that of ﬁre, although this conclusion is based on only one ﬁre disturbance site. In the two years after harvesting, an important time for seedling establishment in managed forest systems, it appears that intensiﬁcation of harvesting does not further disrupt microbial community structure and functioning beyond impacts from current harvest practices.",

Datasets of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, form the basis for UNITE. The current version includes nearly 1 million public fungal ITS sequences. Datasets are curated and annotated by community members. During the past 15 years, they made more than 275 000 improvements. In the complete absence of Latin names for species, UNITE offers a unique system where species hypotheses (SH) are provided with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). The current version 8 of UNITE offers more than 800 000 DOI-based SHs. One such SH DOI page is shown in Fig. 1. These DOI identifiers are also incorporated into the taxonomic backbone, making communication of taxa seamless in both directions. DOI identifiers of species hypotheses are also used by GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) in order to publish high-throughput sequencing taxon occurrence data in their data portal. ‡ § |,¶ # ¤ © Kõljalg U et al.

		"abstract": "Biodiversity metrics are critical for assessment and monitoring of ecosystems threatened by anthropogenic stressors. Existing sorting and identification methods are too expensive and labour-intensive to be scaled up to meet management needs. Alternately, a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach could be used to determine biodiversity metrics from bulk environmental samples collected as part of a large-scale biomonitoring program. Here we show that both morphological and DNA sequence-based analyses are suitable for recovery of individual taxonomic richness, estimation of proportional abundance, and calculation of biodiversity metrics using a set of 24 benthic samples collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta region of Canada. The high-throughput sequencing approach was able to recover all metrics with a higher degree of taxonomic resolution than morphological analysis. The reduced cost and increased capacity of DNA sequence-based approaches will finally allow environmental monitoring programs to operate at the geographical and temporal scale required by industrial and regulatory end-users.",

		"abstract": "Conventional assessments of ecosystem sample composition are based on morphology-based or DNA barcode identification of individuals. Both approaches are costly and time-consuming, especially when applied to the large number of specimens and taxa commonly included in ecological investigations. Next-generation sequencing approaches can overcome the bottleneck of individual specimen isolation and identification by simultaneously sequencing specimens of all taxa in a bulk mixture. Here we apply multiple parallel amplification primers, multiple DNA barcode markers, 454-pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing to the same sample to maximize recovery of the arthropod macrobiome and the bacterial and other microbial microbiome of a bulk arthropod sample. We validate this method with a complex sample containing 1,066 morphologically distinguishable arthropods from a tropical terrestrial ecosystem with high taxonomic diversity. Multiamplicon next-generation DNA barcoding was able to recover sequences corresponding to 91% of the distinguishable individuals in a bulk environmental sample, as well as many species present as undistinguishable tissue. 454-pyrosequencing was able to recover 10 more families of arthropods and 30 more species than did conventional Sanger sequencing of each individual specimen. The use of other loci (16S and 18S ribosomal DNA gene regions) also added the detection of species of microbes associated with these terrestrial arthropods. This method greatly decreases the time and money necessary to perform DNA-based comparisons of biodiversity among ecosystem samples. This methodology opens the door to much cheaper and increased capacity for ecological and evolutionary studies applicable to a wide range of socio-economic issues, as well as a basic understanding of how the world works.",

		"abstract": "Characterizing biodiversity in a habitat or in targeted taxonomically or socioeconomically important groups remains a challenge. Standard DNA-based biodiversity identification tools such as DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are rapidly changing the landscape of biodiversity analysis by targeting various habitats and a wide array of organisms. However, effective use of these technological advances requires optimized protocols and benchmarking against traditional tools. Here we investigate the use of commonly used preservative ethanol as a non-destructive and inexpensive source of DNA for NGS biodiversity analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates. We used the preservative ethanol added to field collected organisms (live sorted bulk benthic samples) as a source of community DNA for NGS environmental barcoding. We directly compare this approach with a DNA barcode library generated using Sanger sequencing of all individuals separated from abenthic sample as well as with NGS environmental barcoding of DNA extracted from mixed/homogenized tissue specimens of the same benthic sample. We also evaluate a multiplex PCR strategy, as compared to commonly used single amplicon workflow, using three newly designed primer sets targeting a wide array of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa.",

Sampling of soil and roots of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. was carried out at 12 P. gigantea-treated and five nontreated control sites representing 1- to 60-month-old clear-cuts and thinned forest sites in Finland and Latvia. The 454-sequencing of ITS rRNA from fine roots, humus and mineral soil resulted in 8626 high-quality fungal sequences. Phlebiopsis gigantea represented 1.3% of all fungal sequences and was found in 14 treated and nontreated sites and in all three substrates. In different substrates, the relative abundance of P. gigantea at stump treatment sites either did not differ significantly or was significantly lower than in nontreated controls. No significant correlation was found between the time elapsed since the tree harvesting and/or application of the biocontrol and abundance of P. gigantea in different substrates. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that P. gigantea occasionally occurs belowground in forest ecosystems but that stump treatment with the biocontrol agent has little or no impact on occurrence and persistence of P. gigantea belowground, and consequently no significant impact on soil fungi.",

		"abstract": "Sequencing of ribosomal DNA clone libraries amplified from environmental DNA has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive rDNA library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two SSU rDNA diversity markers-the variable V4 and V9 regions-from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in GenBank, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity.",

		"abstract": "The natural variation of multiple abiotic stresses in hyper-seasonal edaphic savanna provides a unique opportunity to study the rhizobacteriome community structure of plants adapted to climate change-like conditions in the humid tropics. In this study, we evaluated changes in soil, plant and rhizobacteriome community structure parameters across seasons (wet and dry) in two edaphic savannas (SV-1 and SV-5) using four dominant plant species. We then examined relationships between rhizobacteriome community structure and soil properties, plant biomass, and conventional and novel root traits. We further hypothesized that plants adapted to the Aripo Savanna had a core rhizobacteriome, which was specific to plant species and related to root foraging traits. Our results showed that cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the concentration of micronutrients (Fe, Cu and B) were the only soil factors that differed across savanna and season, respectively. Plant biomass traits were generally higher in the dry season, with a higher allocation to root growth in SV-5. Root traits were more plastic in SV-5, and network length-distribution was the only root trait which showed a consistent pattern of lower values in the dry season for three of the dominant plant species. Rhizobacterial community compositions were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, as well as WPS-2, which is dominant in extreme environments. We identified a shared core rhizobacteriome across plant species and savannas. Cation exchange capacity was a major driver of rhizobacterial community assemblies across savannas. Savanna-specific drivers of rhizobacterial community assemblies included CEC and Fe for SV-1, and CEC, TDS, NH4+, NO3−, Mn, K, and network length-distribution for SV-5. Plant factors on the microbiome were minimal, and host selectivity was mediated by the seasonal changes. We conclude that edaphoclimatic factors (soil and season) are the key determinants influencing rhizobacteriome community structure in multiple stressed-environments, which are ecologically similar to the Aripo Savanna.",

		"abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are a major source of methane (CH4), contributing 0.65 Pg (in CO2 equivalents) yr−1 towards global carbon emissions and offsetting ~25% of the terrestrial carbon sink. Most freshwater CH4 emissions come from littoral sediments, where large quantities of plant material are decomposed. Climate change is predicted to shift plant community composition, and thus change the quality of inputs into detrital food webs, with the potential to affect CH4 production. Here we find that variation in phenol availability from decomposing organic matter underlies large differences in CH4 production in lake sediments. Production is at least 400-times higher from sediments composed of macrophyte litter compared to terrestrial sources because of inhibition of methanogenesis by phenol leachates. Our results now suggest that earth system models and carbon budgets should consider the effects of plant communities on sediment chemistry and ultimately CH4 emissions at a global scale.",

ISSN 1652-6880, ISBN 91-576-7080-3 The potential of microbial community fingerprinting methods to provide information about compost maturity in composting facilities was investigated. Studies in a pilot-scale reactor equipped with independent control of oxygen content and temperature showed that low oxygen contents or low temperature had no dramatic effects on overall development of microbial community structure, determined with the PLFA (phospholipid fatty acid) method, although the process was generally delayed. Analyses of PLFAs typical for Actinobacteria, however, revealed that these bacteria were favoured when the maximum temperature was 40ºC. Actinobacteria populations constituted almost 50% of the microbial community during later stages of the reactor experiments, when only relatively complex, recalcitrant compounds remained, suggesting that some Actinobacteria may be suitable as indicator organisms for mature compost. Studies in a full-scale composting system showed that Actinobacteria constituted a relatively low, but constant proportion at roughly 10% of the microbial community. Analyses of Actinobacteria species composition using PCRDGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) targeting 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that members of Corynebacterium were present at early stages and that thermo-tolerant Actinobacteria, e.g. Thermobifida, Streptosporangium, Saccharomonospora and Saccharopolyspora, were found throughout the long thermophilic phase. During the stage of decreasing temperature, the community included both thermo-tolerant and mesophilic Actinobacteria. The ester-linked fatty acid (EL) method for describing microbial community structure was shown to provide information related to aspects of maturity, and is potentially a relatively simple and fast method of assessing compost maturity. Combination of signature lipid and nucleic acid-based analyses greatly expanded the specificity and scope for assessing microbial community composition in composts.",

		"abstract": "The effects of rhizodeposition on soil C and N availabilities lead to substantial changes of microbial community composition and processes in the rhizosphere of plants. Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (Nmin) and nitrification rates (Nnitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities. Our results demonstrated that clonal integration facilitated N assimilation and uptake in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. The experiment provides insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration.",

		"abstract": "Soil microbial communities modulate soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics by catalyzing litter decomposition. However, our understanding of how litter-derived carbon (C) flows through the microbial portion of the soil food web is far from comprehensive. This information is necessary to facilitate reliable predictions of soil C cycling and sequestration in response to a changing environment such as land use change in the form of agricultural abandonment. To examine the flow of litter-derived C through the soil microbial food web and it’s response to land use change, we carried out an incubation experiment with soils from six fields; three recently abandoned and three long term abandoned fields. In these soils, the fate of 13C-labeled plant litter was followed by analyzing phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) over a period of 56 days. The litter-amended soils were sampled over time to measure 13CO2 and mineral N dynamics. Microbial 13C-incorporation patterns revealed a clear succession of microbial groups during litter decomposition. Fungi were first to incorporate 13C-label, followed by G− bacteria, G+ bacteria, actinomycetes and micro-fauna. The order in which various microbial groups responded to litter decomposition was similar across all the fields examined, with no clear distinction between recent and long-term abandoned soils. Although the microbial biomass was initially higher in long-term abandoned soils, the net amount of 13C-labeled litter that was incorporated by the soil microbial community was ultimately comparable between recent and long-term abandoned fields. In relative terms, this means there was a higher efficiency of litter-derived 13C-incorporation in recent abandoned soil microbial communities compared to long-term abandoned soils, most likely due to a net shift from SOM-derived C toward root-derived C input in the soil microbial food web following land-abandonment.",

		"abstract": "Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiling for characterizing microbial community composition typically is conducted via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) or ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) methods. As soil health assessments aim to be utilized across the nation and globe, the robust measurement and interpretation of microbial communities across a range of soils and environments will be necessary. This study compared PLFA and EL-FAME methods for detecting and interpreting profiles of microbial community composition in croplands across a wide geographic area using a total of 172 soil samples from 14 states representing a wide range of soil properties. Overall, PLFA and EL-FAME provided comparable biomarkers in terms of microbial community composition. The Spearman's Rank correlation test showed positive correlations (r = 0.37–0.71) between PLFA and EL-FAME methods for absolute abundance of total FAME and individual microbial groups including fungi (saprophytic fungi [SF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], and general fungi [F]) and all bacterial groups (Gram positive [GMP], Gram negative [GMN], and Actinobacteria). In both methods, a common set of fatty acids were influential in differentiating samples. The main differences in biomarker abundances between the two methods were that fungal and Actinobacteria biomarkers (e.g., 16:1ω5c [AMF], 18:1ω9c [F], 18:3ω6c [F], and 10Me16:0 [Actinobacteria]) were more abundant or critical in EL-FAME profiling (large variation among soil samples and sensitive to soil properties), but bacterial biomarkers such as i15:0 (GMP), 16:1ω7c (GMN), 18:1ω7c (GMN), and cy19:0ω7c (GMN) were more dominant and responsive to soil properties in PLFA profiling. The practical advantages of EL-FAME are lower cost and simpler methodology. Although both methods produced similar microbial profile abundances for important microbial markers, PLFA was more sensitive to the wide range of soil chemical properties in this sample set including pH, clay content, soil organic matter, and active carbon.",

		"abstract": "Global biodiversity is threatened by the anthropogenic restructuring of animal communities, rewiring species interaction networks in real-time as individuals are extirpated or introduced. Conservation science and adaptive ecosystem management demand more rapid, quantitative, and non-invasive technologies for robustly capturing changing biodiversity and quantifying species interactions. Here we develop molecular ecological network analyses (MENA) as an ecosystem assessment tool to address these needs. To construct the ecological network, we used environmental DNA from feces to identify the plant and mammal diet of two carnivores: puma (Puma concolor) and bobcat (Lynx rufus); two omnivores: coyote (Canis latrans) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus); and two herbivores: black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) in a well-studied Californian reserve. To evaluate MENA as a comprehensive biodiversity tool, we applied our framework to identify the structure of the network, patterns of trophic interactions, key species, and to assess its utility in capturing the biodiversity of the area. The high dietary taxonomic resolution enabled the assessment of species diversity, niche breadth and overlap. The network analysis revealed a dense ecological network with a high diversity of weakly connected species and a community that is highly modular and non-nested. The significant prevalence of tri-trophic chain and exploitative competition patterns indicates (i) the removal or reintroduction of a top predator would trigger a trophic cascade within this community, directly affecting their prey and indirectly the plant communities, and (ii) the potential impact of indirect effects between two predators that consume the same prey. These results suggest that the recent resurgence of puma in the study area may impact the herbaceous and woody vegetation and the population size of other predators. This effect of fluctuating predator populations and plant communities could be predicted through MENA’s fine-scale assessment of the diet selection and the identified keystone species. Although just using a subset of species, MENA more rapidly, accurately, and effectively captured the broader biodiversity of the area in comparison to other methodologies. MENA reconstructed and unveiled the hidden complexity in trophic structure and interaction networks within the community, providing a promising toolkit for biodiversity and ecosystem management.",

Sunlight photodegradation of the chemical was slower (T1/2 = 83.0 h) than the photolysis by ultraviolet radiations (T1/2 values at 254 and 365 nm were 9.92 and 27.6 h, respectively); nevertheless, it was still appreciable during the summer months at 46°31’ N latitude. The differences in degradation rates between the unsterilized and sterilized stream water and the degradation of the chemical in the sterile, distilled water in sunlight, suggests that microbial processes and photolysis are the two main degradative routes for tebufenozide in natural aquatic systems.",

Its persistence and fate in different forestry components after its aerial application were investigated. An emulsion suspension of MIMIC (containing a tracer dye) was applied twice, each time at the rate of 70 g of active ingredient (Al)/ha over a mixed‐wood forest near Longlac, Ontario, Canada, during 1994. Droplet density (droplets/cm2) and volume median diameter were determined on spruce needles [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] after the 1st application, and the values averaged to 3.8 and 60 μm respectively. Droplet density, volume median diameter and deposit density (g Al/ha) determined on collection units near the pond site, were higher for the 1st application than for the 2nd application. In contrast, the corresponding values for the stream site were lower for the 1st application than for the 2nd application. The highest concentration of tebufenozide (μg/g wet wt) in soil was 0.101 for the 1st application, which was slightly lower than the value (0.116) obtained for the 2nd application. The corresponding values in litter were higher, 0.118 and 0.144 respectively. The residues decreased gradually with time and persisted until the last sampling day (87 d post‐spray). The DT50 (time required for 50 % of the initial deposit to dissipate) values were 42.2 d for soil and 80.0 d for litter, indicating the potential for overwintering of tebufenozide residues in these two matrices. The highest concentrations (ng/g fresh wt) of the chemical in spruce needles 1 h after the 1st and 2nd applications were 1.68 and 3.01 respectively, and for spruce shoots (current year growth) 1.06 and 2.08 respectively. The residues in spruce shoots disappeared faster than those in needles, although the chemical persisted in both matrices up to 87 d post‐spray, indicating similar overwintering potential as seen in soil and litter. The DT50 values for the needles and shoots were 44.3 d and 18.4 d, respectively. Higher initial deposits (μg/g fresh wt, 5.18 for 1st application and 5.51 for the 2nd application) were found on balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) leaves than on spruce needles. The DT50 value (58.7 d) was also higher. The stream site received very low deposits during the 1st spray. The maximum 1 h post‐spray concentrations (μg/L) in the stream (2nd application) and pond waters (1st and 2nd applications) were 1.32, 5.31 and 1.26 respectively. Concentrations decreased rapidly in both sites after spray, giving an average DT50 value of 1.6 d. The initial 1‐h concentrations (μg/g wet wt) of the chemical in stream and pond sediments were low and ranged from 0.005 to 0.010. No residues were found in the stream or pond sediments after 4 and 12 d post‐spray (2nd application), respectively. Although the residues were transient, the data indicated a tendency for the sediment to act as a sink by adsorbing the chemical from the surrounding waters. After the second application, stream moss (Drepanoclàdus) gradually accumulated the chemical from an initial low concentration (μg/g, wet wt) of 0.072 (stream) to a peak level of 0.232 at 3 d post‐spray. Similarly, concentrations in pond moss increased from 0.120 (at 1 h) to 0.210 on 1 d post‐spray, indicating that both stream and pond moss acted as efficient sinks for the chemical. Residues declined from peak levels to non‐detectable levels in the stream moss after 38 d post‐application; however, the material persisted at detectable levels (0.015 μg/g) in pond moss beyond the 87 d sampling period. The foliage of marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) acted as a good receptor for the spray droplets. The initial concentrations (μg/g wet wt) of tebufenozide in stream (2nd application) and pond (1st and 2nd applications) samples were 0.896, 4.147 and 1.896 respectively. The residue levels at both sites decreased with time and the DT50 values ranged from 2.0 to 3.9 d (average value of 2.7 d). No residues were found in marigold foliage after 24 d post‐application. Transient but quantifiable levels of the chemical in the range of 0.069 to 0.13 μg/g (wet wt) were found in marigold roots, showing tendencies of bioconcentration. However, the residues declined to below the quantification level within 4 d (stream) and 12 d (pond) after application. Results of the study showed that a consortia of environmental factors (physical, chemical and metabolic) exerted influence to reduce both the duration and concentrations of tebufenozide in the forestry matrices.",

		"abstract": "The development of more affordable high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and powerful bioinformatics is making of shotgun metagenomics a common tool for effective characterization of microbiomes and robust functional genomics. A shotgun metagenomic approach was applied in the characterization of microbial communities associated with plasticized fabric materials exposed to a harsh tropical environment for 14 months. High-throughput sequencing of TruSeq paired-end libraries was conducted using a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform generating 100 bp reads. A multifaceted bioinformatics pipeline was developed and applied to conduct quality control and trimming of raw reads, microbial classification, assembly of multi-microbial genomes, binning of assembled contigs to individual genomes, and prediction of microbial genes and proteins. The bioinformatic analysis of the large 161 Gb sequence dataset generated 3,314,688 contigs and 120 microbial genomes. The raw metagenomic data and the detailed description of the bioinformatics pipeline applied in data analysis provide an important resource for the genomic characterization of microbial communities associated with biodegraded plastic fabric materials. The raw shotgun metagenomics sequence data of microbial communities on plastic fabric materials have been deposited in MG-RAST (https://www.mg-rast.org/) under accession numbers: mgm4794685.3–mgm4794690.3. The datasets and raw data presented here were associated with the main research work “Metagenomic characterization of microbial communities on plasticized fabric materials exposed to harsh tropical environments” (Radwan et al., 2020).",

		"abstract": "Impacts of harvest intensity and soil disturbance on site productivity are likely to vary with stand development stage and interactive processes related to ecosystem function. On upland boreal sites, stand productivity may initially be constrained by microclimatic conditions. However, increasing nutrient demands and overstory light interception associated with canopy development may place progressively greater emphasis on nutrient availability, profile water storage capacity and asymmetric competition. We illustrate these effects using 20-yr post-harvest data from fourteen jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) installations in northern Ontario. Initial growth and ten-year survival were as great or greater without forest floors (NFF), but by year 15 dominant height increments were usually greater with intact forest floors (FF). Growing season frost occurrence and high vapor pressure deficits occurred more frequently with FF than NFF treatments during the initial stand establishment phase. Similarly, mean growing season soil temperatures were 2-5˚C warmer with NFF during this phase, with stand Leaf Area Index (LAI) values < 0.5. During the following Accelerated Growth phase, treatment differences in microclimate dissipated as LAI increased. Foliar N concentrations and N:P ratios, and soil net N mineralization were usually greater from an early age with FF, and often declined as canopy closure approached. Likewise, modelled site-level constraints related to soil water availability increased with stand development, peaking at LAI values associated with the stem exclusion stage. Placing post-harvest response (i.e., impacts of harvest intensity) in the context of relationships among stand structural development, changes in microclimate, and resource supply and demand should provide greater insights into longer-term effects of establishment practices.",

		"abstract": "The impact of harvesting intensity, vegetation control and fertilization on soil N availability 5–20 years postharvest was determined at 18 jack pine and black spruce forests in northern Ontario, Canada. The study sites are affiliated with the North American long-term soil productivity (LTSP) study. Boreal forest growth is commonly N limited and young stands approaching crown closure acquire most of their N from the soil. The study sites represented a range of soil types and were harvested with three levels of organic matter removal (stem-only harvest, full-tree harvest and full-tree harvest with organic horizon removal by blading). Three study sites had multiple applications of glyphosate to control competing vegetation and one site included a trial with two applications of N, P, K fertilizer to the full-tree harvest treatment. We used short-term anaerobic laboratory incubations and in-situ closed top tube growing season incubations to determine mineralizable N and net N mineralization, respectively. Profile (organic plus mineral horizons) mineralizable N pools were higher in operational clearcut (stem-only and full-tree harvesting) treatments compared to the uncut reference forest 10–14 years post harvest. Full-tree harvesting with blading significantly reduced profile mineralizable N pools at this time compared to operational harvesting, while the same treatment at one upland site also reduced net N mineralization pools. Profile mineralizable N pools and microbial biomass C and N were lower in full-tree compared to stem-only harvesting treatments, suggesting that increased slash retention with stem-only har­ vesting was playing a role in enhanced soil N availability at a time when plantations were approaching a period of greater N demand. Fertilization and vegetation control treatments had few effects on N indices, although net N mineralization pools for the stem-only and full-tree harvest that also had the repeated herbicide treatment were consistently, but not significantly, lower than non-herbicided treatments. Soil N indices were useful predictors of dominant height growth for jack pine to a greater degree than for black spruce, and soil N concentrations were as effective at predicting height growth as more resource intensive measurements. Our results point to the importance of continued monitoring of soil and stand conditions at these LTSP sites as treatment effects on soil N cycling and site productivity will likely continue to evolve. At this stage of stand development, full-tree har­ vesting plus organic horizon removal, followed by operational harvesting has led to lower soil N availability than operational tree-length harvesting, and stands with understory vegetation control are now showing indications of reduced N availability.",

		"abstract": "Forest residue left on the ground following harvesting (i.e., “slash”) plays an important role in moderating the physical and chemical environment of the soil for future forest growth. Leaving too little slash can leave the soil exposed to extreme fluctuations in soil conditions and fewer nutrients that may hinder future forest growth, while leaving too much slash makes it difficult for new trees to establish or increases fire hazard. This study investigated the impacts of blading and different loadings of slash (0, 15, 30 and 60 Mg ha− 1 dry mass) on soil physical (temperature and moisture), chemical (soil solution) and biological (soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange) processes over 4 summers at a harvested jack pine stand within the Island Lake Biomass Harvest Experiment in northeastern Ontario. Soil temperature and moisture were highest in the bladed and lowest in the 60 Mg ha− 1 slash loading. Soil solution chemistry was generally similar among the 0, 15 and 30 Mg ha− 1 slash loadings. However, total organic carbon and potassium had higher concentrations at 60 Mg ha− 1 treatment and lower concentrations in the bladed treatment, the opposite trend occurred for pH and nitrate. Over three years the concentrations of cations decreased and nitrogen species increased for bladed to 30 Mg ha− 1 treatments. The 60 Mg ha− 1 treatment had increases in some solutes over time suggesting there is a lag effect as needles and bark are incorporated into the soil. The soil respiration data showed that lowest rates of CO2 production occurred in the bladed treatment, but increased over time as the forest floor developed. CO2 production was highest in the 60 Mg ha− 1 slash loading, with high rates of soil respiration in the first year, as fine debris from slash deposited onto the soil, however little photosynthesis occurred in these treatments. Thus retention of small to moderate amounts of slash seem to be sufficient for maintaining a suitable balance of soil conditions for a regenerating forest over the short term.",

		"abstract": "In North American boreal forests, woody biomass is increasingly becoming an attractive bioenergy feedstock as it represents a more renewable, and low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. However, concerns over the ecological sustainability of an intensification of biomass harvesting over the long term remain. We assessed the effects of a gradient of biomass removal established 20 years ago in five jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands across northeastern Ontario on the taxonomic and functional structure of ground-dwelling Collembola and Oribatida communities. Essential to soil functioning, these two major taxa of mesofauna are dependent on microhabitats and food supply such as fungi provided by woody debris. Three treatments were considered including stem-only harvesting, whole-tree harvesting (stem, tops and branches removed), and blading (whole-tree harvesting plus removal of stump and forest floor). Adjacent uncut mature (±90 year-old) stands were considered as reference state conditions (i.e. the endpoint of stand development following stand replacing disturbance). Soil mesofauna were collected and environmental variables measured across all treatments. We identified species of both taxa and measured a suite of functional response traits such as body length and reproduction strategy. Compared to mature uncut forests, soil mesofaunal communities remained modified 20 years after biomass harvesting, notably in the most intense practice (blading). Treatment effects were more evident in Oribatida communities both taxonomically (lower density, biomass, species diversity and shifted composition) and functionally (lower diversity and modified trait composition resulting from fewer surface-dwelling, fast-dispersing and micro-detritivorous species) than in Collembola communities. This taxa-specific response may reflect generally shorter lifespans, higher reproduction rates and faster dispersal of Collembola than Oribatida. Incomplete recovery of mesofauna was consistent with persistent modifications of soil environmental conditions in harvested plots, notably after blading. Modifications included a reduced organic cover (ground vegetation, mosses and woody debris) as well as lower organic soil thickness and moisture, which likely resulted in fewer suitable microhabitats for many species. Using complementary taxonomic and trait-based approaches to highlight the underlying mechanisms of mesofaunal responses, our study revealed that recovery is incomplete within 20 years after intensive biomass removal in these boreal conifer-dominated stands, and is likely linked to stand development and associated processes. As a result, longer-term monitoring will be required to track mesofaunal community recovery through these later developmental stages.",

		"abstract": "Forest residues and logging slash from pre-commercial forest thinning and regeneration harvests are a potential feedstock for bioenergy production but there has been a concern about the impact of residue removal on forest soil C and N. This study aimed to address such by conducting two meta-analyses using the data available from published literature and an independent dataset compiled from the North American Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) study. For the meta-analysis using literature, we categorized forest harvesting and biomass removal into i) no harvest control, ii) bole-only (BO, partial or clearcut) regular harvests, iii) BO with partial removal of logging slash and/or O horizon (BO+Removal), iv) whole tree harvests (WTH), and v) WTH with slash and O horizon removal (WTH+Removal). Accordingly, we compiled soil C and N data and key statistics (e.g., standard deviation) from 142 scientific articles published since 1979. We compared the results from this meta-analysis with data from 22 installations of the LTSP study where three levels of organic matter removal - BO, WTH, and WTH plus forest floor (+FF, O horizon) removal - as well as an additional vegetation control (+VC) were measured for two decades in either completely randomized or randomized block design. In the literature meta-analysis, BO+Removal (-19.2%), WTH (-15.4%) and WTH+Removal (-24.9%) contained significantly less soil C than no-harvest controls across combined soil depths, while BO had no difference. Within individual mineral soil horizons, only BO+Removal and WTH+Removal treatments contained significantly less carbon than controls. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in treatment response between studies in the literature. The analyses from the LTSP dataset showed no significant difference in combined soil depths for WTH or WTH+VC relative to BO harvest, but there was significantly less soil C in BO+VC (-3.6%), WTH+FF (-8.5%) and WTH+FF+VC (-15.3%). These treatment effects declined over time since harvest, particularly the most intensive treatments. Soil N results largely mirrored soil C in both meta-analyses with smaller estimated effects for most treatments at equivalent depths (except for WTH+Removal and WTH+FF+VC, which remain about the same). There were no significant differences in soil N for combined soil depths between WTH and no-harvest control (in the literature analysis) or BO harvest (for both analyses). Since the most severe losses of soil C and N involved FF removal, WTH that accounts for modest removals (<80%) of harvesting residues may provide a sustainable source of biomass for bioenergy production without additional soil impacts compared to BO harvesting practices.",

This study was conducted in north-central Ontario (47°42=N, 83°36=W) in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) dominated stands in 2013 using pitfall trapping. Using 222 species (12 015 individuals), we compared the effects of disturbance using recently burned (3 years since ﬁre) and clearcut sites (3 years since harvest; tree length, full tree, stump removal, and blading), as well as older, closed-canopy stands that have regenerated following clearcutting (51 years since harvest) and ﬁre (92 years since ﬁre), with multivariate regression trees. Taxa were more similar in the three controls (including recent ﬁre) than between controls and harvest treatments, with increased forest ﬂoor disturbance in harvested plots being a likely explanation. In addition, taxa were different in the younger (51 years) harvest-origin plots than in the older (92 years) ﬁre-origin plots, suggesting that communities had not yet recovered from the harvest disturbance possibly due to insufﬁcient coarse woody debris in the younger stand. These results indicate that forest management practices that match natural forest ﬂoor disturbance could ameliorate short-term effects, whereas the maintenance of more coarse woody debris could reduce the recovery time of epigaeic communities.",

		"abstract": "Concerns about climate change and the desire to develop a domestic, renewable energy source are increasing the interest in forest biomass extraction, especially in the form of logging residues, i.e., tree tops and branches. We reviewed the literature to determine the site and soil conditions under which removal of logging residues along with the stem (i.e., whole-tree harvesting), especially at clearcut, results in negative impacts on soil productivity compared with conventional stem-only harvesting in boreal and temperate forests. Negative impacts of biomass harvesting on soil nutrient pools (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus and base cations) and soil acid-base status are more frequent in the forest floor than in the mineral soil. In the first years post-harvest, however, biomass harvesting has the greatest potential to influence tree survival and growth, either positively or negatively, through its effects on microclimate and competing vegetation. Later in the rotation, impaired nitrogen and (or) phosphorus nutrition on whole-tree harvested sites has been shown to reduce tree growth for at least 20 years in some stands. Biomass removal can also reduce the concentrations of base cations in soils and foliage, but this has not, to date, been shown to affect tree productivity. There are no consistent, unequivocal and universal effects of forest biomass harvesting on soil productivity. However, climate and microclimate, mineral soil texture and organic C content, the capacity of the soil to provide base cations and phosphorus, and tree species autecology appear to be critical determinants of site sensitivity to biomass harvesting. Rigorous, long-term experiments that follow stand development through a rotation will facilitate the identification of categories of site or stand conditions under which negative impacts of biomass harvesting are likely. Key words: forest biomass, whole-tree harvesting, soil productivity, tree nutrition, stand productivity. Résumé : Les préoccupations au sujet des changements climatiques et la volonté de développer des sources d'énergie domestique renouvelable augmentent l'intérêt pour l'extraction de la biomasse forestière, surtout sous la forme de résidus de coupe, c.-à-d., les cimes et les branches des arbres. Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de littérature pour déterminer les conditions de site et de sol pour lesquelles l'enlèvement des résidus de coupe en plus de la tige (c.-à-d., la coupe par arbre entier ), surtout lors de coupes à blanc, conduit à des impacts négatifs sur la productivité des sols comparativement à la récolte conventionnelle du tronc seulement, en forêts boréales et tempérées. Les impacts négatifs de la récolte de la biomasse sur les réserves du sol en nutriments (p. ex. azote, phosphore et cations basiques) et sur le statut acidité-alcalinité apparaissent plus fréquents dans l'humus que dans le sol minéral. Cependant, au cours des premières années suivant la récolte, le prélèvement de la biomasse montre le plus fort potentiel pour influencer la survie des arbres et leur croissance, soit positivement soit négativement, par ses effets sur le microclimat et la végétation compétitrice. Plus tard dans la révolution, on observe que pour certains peuplements, une nutrition amoindrie en azote et (ou) phosphore sur les sites avec coupe par arbre entier réduit la croissance des arbres pendant au moins 20 ans. Le prélèvement de la biomasse peut également réduire les teneurs en cations basiques dans les sols et le feuillage, mais ceci ne semble pas se traduire en effet sur la productivité. Il n'y a pas d'effets non équivoques et universels de la récolte de la biomasse sur la productivité des sols. Cependant, le climat et le microclimat, la granulométrie du sol, sa teneur en C organique, sa capacité á fournir les cations basiques et le phosphore, ainsi que l'autécologie des espèces semblent constituer des déterminants importants de la sensibilité des sites à la récolte de la biomasse. Des expériences rigoureuses, conduites à long terme pour suivre le développement des peuplements tout au long de la révolution, faciliteront l'identification des catégories de sites ou les conditions des peuplements pour lesquels des impacts négatifs sont susceptibles de se développer.",

		"abstract": "Demand for woody biomass fuels is increasing amidst concerns about global energy security and climate change, but there may be negative implications of increased harvesting for forest ecosystem functions and their benefits to society (ecosystem services). Using new methods for assessing ecosystem services based on long-term experimental research, post-harvest changes in ten potential benefits were assessed for ten first-order northern hardwood forest watersheds at three long-term experimental research sites in northeastern North America. As expected, we observed near-term tradeoffs between biomass provision and greenhouse gas regulation, as well as tradeoffs between intensive harvest and the capacity of the forest to remediate nutrient pollution. In both cases, service provision began to recover along with the regeneration of forest vegetation; in the case of pollution remediation, the service recovered to pre-harvest levels within 10 years. By contrast to these two services, biomass harvesting had relatively nominal and transient impacts on other ecosystem services. Our results are sensitive to empirical definitions of societal demand, including methods for scaling societal demand to ecosystem units, which are often poorly resolved. Reducing uncertainty around these parameters can improve confidence in our results and increase their relevance for decision-making. Our synthesis of long-term experimental studies provides insights on the social-ecological resilience of managed forest ecosystems to multiple drivers of change.",

		"abstract": "As international demand for renewable energy and forest biomass increases, there is considerable debate about the effect of increased removals on long-term soil productivity. Carbon and nutrient contents of the aboveground biomass, forest floor, and mineral soil were determined at 14 boreal forest sites in northern Ontario. At each site, three treatments were performed: tree-length harvesting (OM0), full-tree harvesting (OM1) and full-tree harvesting plus forest floor removal (OM2). Theoretical and actual estimates of biomass removal for OM0 and OM1 were determined. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) dominant height increments from Years 10 to 15 (HD10-15) were determined as a measure of site productivity. A nutrient budget approach was used to estimate C and nutrient removal and retention and to calculate stability ratios (i.e., ratio of nutrient removed during harvest to post-harvest nutrient reserve) and nutrient replacement times. The OM1 treatment removed 65% of the potentially available biomass; on average 27 Mg ha−1 of unutilized biomass was burned in slash piles. The OM1 harvesting residue retention values coincided with guidelines of jurisdictions that recommend retaining one-third of residues on site after bioenergy harvesting. The OM0 and OM1 C and nutrient removals were more similar than estimated in previous studies. Base cation stability ratios and nutrient replacement times gave opposite interpretations in terms of which sites were more sensitive to biomass removal treatments. For sandy sites with thin forest floor horizons HD10–15 responded positively to increased post-harvest soil C reserves, but for sites with thick forest floors, organic matter accumulation became a detriment to increased growth.",

		"abstract": "Biomass harvesting removes more woody material than would be taken with conventional forest harvesting. Harvesting residues, left on site are an important substrate for micro-organisms that maintain nutrient cycles essential for future forest productivity by mineralizing organic matter, and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a respiratory bi-product. We assessed the impact of biomass removal intensity (stem-only [SO], full-tree biomass [FT], full-tree biomass plus stumping [FT+S], full-tree biomass plus stumps and forest floor removed [FT+B]), and herbicide application on soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange of carbon (C) in a harvested 40-yr-old jack pine stand. Soil respiration (surface CO2 efflux) normalized to 15°C (R15) was lower in biomass harvest treatments than in the uncut stand and a mature 80-yr-old fire-origin natural stand. Among harvest treatments, R15 was positively related to the amount of C retained, with the general pattern of FT+B<FT+S<FT≈SO. Differences in R15 among treatments were primarily related to residue and soil organic matter quantity and quality (i.e., presence of mineral soil and forest floor polysaccharide). Herbicide application further reduced R15 by diminishing root respiration, although herbicide treatments in the SO, FT and FT+S resulted in greater net CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere in August because herbaceous photosynthesis was greatly reduced. We suggest that criteria for determining site-specific biomass retention should take into account the amount and type of residue required to maintain microbial soil respiration driving nutrient cycling.",

		"abstract": "Substrate quality and the availability of nutrients are major factors controlling microbial decomposition processes in soils. Seasonal alteration in resource availability, which is driven by plants via belowground C allocation, nutrient uptake and litter fall, also exerts effects on soil microbial community composition. Here we investigate if seasonal and experimentally induced changes in microbial community composition lead to alterations in functional properties of microbial communities and thus microbial processes. Beech forest soils characterized by three distinct microbial communities (winter and summer community, and summer community from a tree girdling plot, in which belowground carbon allocation was interrupted) were incubated with different 13C-labeled substrates with or without inorganic N supply and analyzed for substrate use and various microbial processes. Our results clearly demonstrate that the three investigated microbial communities differed in their functional response to addition of various substrates. The winter communities revealed a higher capacity for degradation of complex C substrates (cellulose, plant cell walls) than the summer communities, indicated by enhanced cellulase activities and reduced mineralization of soil organic matter. In contrast, utilization of labile C sources (glucose) was lower in winter than in summer, demonstrating that summer and winter community were adapted to the availability of different substrates. The saprotrophic community established in girdled plots exhibited a significantly higher utilization of complex C substrates than the more plant root associated community in control plots if additional nitrogen was provided. In this study we were able to demonstrate experimentally that variation in resource availability as well as seasonality in temperate forest soils cause a seasonal variation in functional properties of soil microorganisms, which is due to shifts in community structure and physiological adaptations of microbial communities to altered resource supply.",

		"abstract": "Climate warming will shift the seasonal variation of the soil microbial community and thereby regulate the soil process dynamics of forest ecosystems. To evaluate the effects of warming on soil microbial community seasonal dynamics, an in situ experiment was conducted in a natural forest and a dragon spruce plantation in the subalpine region of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Open-top chambers (OTCs) were used to increase the mean soil temperature by 0.54 and 0.58°C for the natural forest and plantation, respectively. Our results showed that the initial levels of soil carbon and nitrogen were much higher in the natural forest than in the plantation. Compared to no-warming, the annual average soil carbon and nitrogen contents increased by 14% and 16% in the natural forest, but decreased by 7 and 6% in the plantation after 4 years of OTC warming, respectively. Conversely, warming caused a significant reduction in the annual average microbial biomass by approximately 50% in the natural forest but enhanced this parameter by approximately 30% in the plantation. Warming further enlarged the differences in seasonal variation in microbial community composition between the two forests. The seasonal variation in microbial community-level substrate utilization also responded differently to warming in the two forest types. These opposite responses of the soil microbial community and soil properties to warming will further magnify the differences in soil conditions between the two forest types under future climate warming. Highlights Soil microbial biomass is reduced by warming in the natural forest but increased in the plantation. Seasonal shifts of microbial community respond differently to warming in the two forests. Soil initial properties likely affect responses of microbial community to warming. Warming will enlarge the differences between the two forests.",

We here investigated two Alpine forest sites (deciduous forest vs. coniferous forest) situated at different altitudes (altitudinal effect) in spring and autumn (seasonal effect) regarding: (i) bacterial and fungal abundances (qPCR); (ii) diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal communities (amplicon sequencing); and (iii) diversity and composition of microbial functional gene community (Geochip 5.0). Significant altitudinal changes were detected in microbial abundances as well as in diversity and composition of taxonomic and functional communities as a consequence of the differences in pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient contents and soil temperatures measured between both sites. A network analysis revealed that deciduous forest site (at lower altitude) presented a lower resistance to environmental changes than that of coniferous forest site (at higher altitude). Significant seasonal effects were detected only for the diversity (higher values in autumn) and composition of microbial functional gene community, which was related to the non-significant increased SOM and nutrient contents detected in autumn respect to spring and the presumable high capacity of soil microbial communities to respond in functional terms to discreet environmental changes.",

In this study, we tested whether the fungal communities differ among three species of co-occurring Ericaceae. • Fungi colonizing Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea roots in the Arctic tundra were characterized via culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The cultured fungi were tested for their ability to colonize Vaccinium uliginosum in laboratory-based assays. • The pure-cultured Helotiales were grouped into eight clades and dominated by the Phialocephala–Acephala complex. Representatives of these clades, plus an unknown basidiomycete with affinity to the genus Irpex (Polyporales), colonized V. uliginosum intracellularly. The Helotiales detected by direct PCR, cloning and sequencing were assigned to 14 clades and dominated by members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae complex. Ordination analyses indicated that culture-dependent and culture-independent assays provided distinct views of root fungal communities, but no evidence for host specificity. • These data suggest that ericaceous roots host diverse fungal communities dominated by the Helotiales. However, these fungal communities are unlikely to be controlled by fungal host preferences. The mechanisms maintaining high diversity in root-symbiotic communities remain to be elucidated.",

Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Hyphomicrobiaceae / Blastochloris Blastochloris species are anoxygenic phototrophic Alphaproteobacteria that have bacteriochlorophyll b in their photosynthetic reaction centers. Crystals of the photosynthetic reaction centers of Blastochloris viridis were the first that have been studied in high-resolution structure analysis at 3 Å resolution. Internal photosynthetic membranes are present as lamellae underlying and parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane. Cells are rod shaped to ovoid and exhibit polar growth, budding, and asymmetric cell division and form rosette-like cell aggregates. They are motile by means of subpolar flagella and stain Gram-negative. Straight-chain monounsaturated C18:1 is the predominant component of cellular fatty acids. Ubiquinones and menaquinones are present, and the lipopolysaccharides are characterized by a 2,3-diamino-2,3-deoxy-d-glucose (DAG)-containing, phosphate-free lipid A with amide-bound C14:0 3OH.

		"abstract": "A novel myxobacterium, MCy1366(T) (Ar1733), was isolated in 1981 from a soil sample collected from a region near Tokyo, Japan. It displayed general myxobacterial features like Gram-negative-staining, rod-shaped vegetative cells, gliding on solid surfaces, microbial lytic activity, fruiting-body-like aggregates and myxospore-like structures. The strain was mesophilic, aerobic and showed a chemoheterotrophic mode of nutrition. It was resistant to many antibiotics such as cephalosporin C, kanamycin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, polymyxin and bacitracin, and the key fatty acids of whole cell hydrolysates were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 2-OH. The genomic DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 65.6 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence showed highest similarity (97.60 %) to 'Stigmatella koreensis' strain KYC-1019 (GenBank accession no. EF112185). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and MALDI-TOF MS data revealed a novel branch in the family Myxococcaceae. DNA-DNA hybridization showed only 28 % relatedness between the novel strain and the closest recognized species, Corallococcus exiguus DSM 14696(T) (97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). A recent isolate from a soil sample collected in Switzerland, MCy10622, displayed 99.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with strain MCy1366(T) and showed almost the same characteristics. Since some morphological features like fruiting-body-like aggregates were barely reproducible in the type strain, the newly isolated strain, MCy10622, was also intensively studied. On the basis of a comprehensive taxonomic study, we propose a novel genus and species, Aggregicoccus edonensis gen. nov., sp. nov., for strains MCy1366(T) and MCy10622. The type strain of the type species is MCy1366(T) ( = DSM 27872(T) = NCCB 100468(T)).",

Planctomycetes / Planctomycetia / Gemmatales / Gemmataceae / Fimbriiglobus The genus Fimbriiglobus is represented by planctomycetes with spherical cells, which occur singly, in pairs, or are assembled in large aggregates. Cell division occurs by means of budding; both daughter and adult cells are nonmotile. Cells are uniformly covered by numerous fimbriae and crateriform pits. Members of the genus are moderately acidophilic and mesophilic chemoorganotrophic aerobes. Most sugars and a number of polysaccharides are used as growth substrates. Type strain of the type species, Fimbriiglobus ruber SP5T, is capable of hydrolyzing chitin, which is used as a source of nitrogen. The major fatty acids are C20:1 ω9c, C16:1 ω9c, and C16:0. The major polar lipid is trimethylornithine. This genus is a member of the phylum Planctomycetes, class Planctomycetia, order Gemmatales, family Gemmataceae.

		"abstract": "A novel facultatively anaerobic bacterium, strain HC45T, was isolated from sediment of a brackish meromictic lake in Japan, Lake Harutori. Cells were pleomorphic, and filamentous bodies were 5-100 μm in length. For growth, the optimum pH was 7.0 and the optimum temperature was 45-50 °C. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71 mol%. iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0 were the major components in the cellular fatty acid profile. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-7. Strain HC45T shared very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with cultivated strains ( ≤ 85%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate was distantly related to members of the family Symbiobacteriaceae and family XVII Incertae Sedis in the class Clostridia, and they formed a cluster separate from canonical species of the phylum Firmicutes. These results indicated that strain HC45T should not be placed in any existing class of the phylum Firmicutes. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic characterization, Limnochorda pilosa gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed with HC45T ( = NBRC 110152T = DSM 28787T) as the type strain, as the first representative of novel taxa, Limnochordales ord. nov., Limnochordaceae fam. nov. in Limnochordia classis. nov.",

Chloroflexi / Anaerolineae / Anaerolineales / Anaerolineaceae Cells are nonmotile, non-spore-forming, Gram-stain-negative, and multicellular filaments. Known members of the family Anaerolineaceae are mesophilic or thermophilic, and grow under neutrophilic conditions. Growth occurs under strictly anaerobic conditions. All members of Anaerolineaceae are chemoheterotrophs. Yeast extract is required for growth with a few exceptions, such as those of the genus Thermomarinilinea. Most members of Anaerolineaceae fermentatively utilize sugars and proteinaceous compounds. Utilization of common external electron acceptors is not observed for growth. However, cocultivation with hydrogenotrophic methanogens enhances the growth of some Anaerolineaceae species, indicating that the Anaerolineaceae can use hydrogenotrophs as a hydrogen(electron)-scavenging system. Most Anaerolineaceae are resistant to rifampicin. The Anaerolineaceae have been isolated from anoxic ecosystems, such as anaerobic sludge, rice paddy soil, deep terrestrial subsurface hot aquifers, shallow sea hydrothermal vents, and marine subsurface sediment.

Acidobacteria / Acidobacteriia / Acidobacteriales / Acidobacteriaceae / Terriglobus Terriglobus is a genus in the phylum Acidobacteria in the family Acidobacteriaceae, order Acidobacteriales, class Acidobacteriia, subdivision 1. It currently comprises five species—Terriglobus roseus, Terriglobus saanensis, Terriglobus tenax, Terriglobus aquaticus, and Terriglobus albidus. Members of the genus are widely distributed in soils including rhizosphere soils and the phyllosphere and are also found in freshwater and in association with insects. This genus encompasses bacteria that are chemoorganotrophs and have obligatory aerobic metabolism with an optimal growth in mildly acidic (pH ∼5–6) and mesophilic (about 25–30°C) conditions. Colonies of Terriglobus are typically circular in form with a convex elevation and can be with or without pink pigmentation. These bacteria can use a range of different carbon sources, and nitrogen is attained by exogenous amino acids or ammonium chloride. Cells are nonmotile, Gram-stain-negative with lengths and widths ranging from 0.8 to 3 µm and 0.4 to 0.9 µm, respectively. Some strains produce extracellular material, which can be visualized by microscopy or in liquid culture, generating a floc/clumping phenotype.

		"abstract": "Species of the genus Coniochaeta (anamorph: Lecythophora) are known as pathogens of woody hosts, but can also cause opportunistic human infections. Several fungi with conidial stages resembling Lecythophora were isolated from necrotic wood samples of Prunus trees in South Africa. In order to reveal their phylogenetic relationships, these fungi were studied on a morphological and molecular (5.8S nrDNA, ITS-1, ITS-2, GAPDH, EF-1alpha, 28S nrDNA, 18S nrDNA) basis. Some of the isolates were identified as Coniochaeta (Sordariomycetes), including C. velutina and two new species, C. africana and C. prunicola. The majority of the isolates, however, formed pycnidial or pseudopycnidial synanamorphs and were not closely related to Coniochaeta. According to their 28S nrDNA phylogeny, they formed two distinct groups, one of which was closely related to Helotiales (Leotiomycetes). The new genus Collophora is proposed, comprising five species that frequently occur in necrotic peach and nectarine wood, namely Co. africana, Co. capensis, Co. paarla, Co. pallida and Co. rubra. The second group was closely related to Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (Eurotiomycetes), occurring mainly in plum wood. Besides P. zymoides occurring on Prunus salicina, four new species are described, namely P. dura, P. effusa, P. prunicola and P. tardicola. In a preliminary inoculation study, pathogenicity was confirmed for some of the new species on apricot, peach or plum wood.",

		"abstract": "Using a heat-treatment method, two genera of heat-resistant and xerotolerant basidiomycetes were isolated from soil samples. These two genera, Basidioascus and Geminibasidium gen. nov., are morphologically similar and phylogenetically related. The genus Basidioascus originally was described as an ascomycete, but the structures originally interpreted as single-spored asci appear to represent basidiospores. Morphologically both genera are characterized by the lack of a fruiting body, conspicuously granular and deciduous basidia with a unique basal lateral projection and apparently double-walled basidiospores. The basidia, rather than the basidiospores, are forcibly discharged in Basidioascus species but not in Geminibasidium species. In Geminibasidium species a putative basidium arises from a primary cell. These are novel forms of basidia ontogenesis previously unseen in basidiomycetes. The rDNA (SSU + 5.8S + LSU) Bayesian phylogenetic analysis suggests that these fungi are distantly related to Wallemia, another xerotolerant basidiomycete genus commonly found in indoor air dust, dried foods and natural hypersaline environments. Given the physiological similarity and phylogenetic relationships, Basidioascus and Geminibasidium are classified in a new order, Geminibasidiales, and are taxonomically assigned to the class Wallemiomycetes. Based on morphological observations and molecular phylogeny of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), two species of Basidioascus (B. undulatus, B. magus sp. nov.) and two species of Geminibasidium (G. donsium sp. nov., G. hirsutum sp. nov.) are described. A key to these species is provided using micromorphological and cultural characters.",

		"abstract": "This chapter presents an overview of current understanding of the structure and development of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots. An ECM root is characterized by the presence of three structural components: a sheath or mantle of fungal tissue which encloses the root, a labyrinthine inward growth of hyphae between the epidermal and cortical cells called the Hartig net, and an outwardly growing system of hyphal elements (the extraradical or external mycelium), which form essential connections both with the soil and with the sporocarps of the fungi forming the ectomycorrhizas. Almost all of the plants upon which ectomycorrhizas develop are woody perennials. The anatomical structures of the mantle and of the emanating mycelia are stable at least at the level of the fungal genus and are increasingly used to facilitate characterization of ectomycorrhizas. Advances have been made towards an understanding of the molecular events associated with the formation of mycorrhizas at the level of the individual root tip. Transcriptional profiling has enabled the identities of some of the genes that are upregulated during formation of the symbiosis to be elucidated. Among others, those involved in modification of cell wall structure, in glycolysis, the TCA cycle and respiratory activity have been identified. Work on the characterization of the extraradical mycelial systems of ECM roots has progressed. New methods enabling quantification of its biomass in the field have been developed, and, using molecular methods that now facilitate the identification of small lengths of ECM hyphae, information on selective niche exploitation is being obtained. Genetic profiling of fungal communities associated with fine roots has further confirmed that there is little correspondence between production of sporocarps and representation of a given fungus as a root symbiont and has identified fungi with hypogeous or resupinate fruit bodies as important components of many mycorrhizal fine root communities.",

		"abstract": "Chaetothyriales is an ascomycetous order within Eurotiomycetes. The order is particularly known through the black yeasts and filamentous relatives that cause opportunistic infections in humans. All species in the order are consistently melanized. Ecology and habitats of species are highly diverse, and often rather extreme in terms of exposition and toxicity. Families are defined on the basis of evolutionary history, which is reconstructed by time of divergence and concepts of comparative biology using stochastical character mapping and a multi-rate Brownian motion model to reconstruct ecological ancestral character states. Ancestry is hypothesized to be with a rock-inhabiting life style. Ecological disparity increased significantly in late Jurassic, probably due to expansion of cytochromes followed by colonization of vacant ecospaces. Dramatic diversification took place subsequently, but at a low level of innovation resulting in strong niche conservatism for extant taxa. Families are ecologically different in degrees of specialization. One of the clades has adapted ant domatia, which are rich in hydrocarbons. In derived families, similar processes have enabled survival in domesticated environments rich in creosote and toxic hydrocarbons, and this ability might also explain the pronounced infectious ability of vertebrate hosts observed in these families. Conventional systems of morphological classification poorly correspond with recent phylogenetic data. Species are hypothesized to have low competitive ability against neighboring microbes, which interferes with their laboratory isolation on routine media. The dataset is unbalanced in that a large part of the extant biodiversity has not been analyzed by molecular methods, novel taxonomic entities being introduced at a regular pace. Our study comprises all available species sequenced to date for LSU and ITS, and a nomenclatural overview is provided. A limited number of species could not be assigned to any extant family.",

		"abstract": "Root endophytism and mycorrhizal associations are complex derived traits in fungi that shape plant physiology. Sebacinales (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) display highly diverse interactions with plants. Although early-diverging Sebacinales lineages are root endophytes and/or have saprotrophic abilities, several more derived clades harbour obligate biotrophs forming mycorrhizal associations. Sebacinales thus display transitions from saprotrophy to endophytism and to mycorrhizal nutrition within one fungal order. This review discusses the genomic traits possibly associated with these transitions. We also show how molecular ecology revealed the hyperdiversity of Sebacinales and their evolutionary diversification into two sister families: Sebacinaceae encompasses mainly ectomycorrhizal and early-diverging saprotrophic species; the second family includes endophytes and lineages that repeatedly evolved ericoid, orchid and ectomycorrhizal abilities. We propose the name Serendipitaceae for this family and, within it, we transfer to the genus Serendipita the endophytic cultivable species Piriformospora indica and P. williamsii. Such cultivable Serendipitaceae species provide excellent models for root endophytism, especially because of available genomes, genetic tractability, and broad host plant range including important crop plants and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We review insights gained with endophytic Serendipitaceae species into the molecular mechanisms of endophytism and of beneficial effects on host plants, including enhanced resistance to abiotic and pathogen stress.

The genus Rhizoclosmatium currently includes three additional described species: R. aurantiacum and R. hyalinum, which can grow on chitin, and R. marinum reported growing on a marine green alga. Our study employed analyses of ribosomal gene sequences, zoospore ultrastructure, and thallus morphology and development to identify chytrid strains related to Rhizoclosmatium. Phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal genes of strains revealed three major lineages within a clade that includes the type, R. globosum. Based on these results, we describe four new species and one new variety of Rhizoclosmatium, all capable of growth on chitin: R. sparsum, R. umbonatum, R. umbonatum var. sphaericum, R. persicum, and R. pessaminum. We have also found that R. globosum strains can grow on a range of substrates, including chitin, cellulose, keratin, and pollen. This information is herein assimilated into the existing taxonomy of the genus, which is also summarized and nomenclaturally updated.

		"abstract": "A novel moderately thermophilic, weakly acidophilic, heterotrophic, anaerobic, short-rod bacterium having an outer sheath-like structure (toga) was isolated from a low-salt acidic terrestrial hot spring in Oku-Shiobara, Tochigi, Japan. The strain, designated NAS-01T, grew between 30 and 60 °C (optimum 55 °C), and at pH 4.5 and 7.5 (optimum pH 5.5 to 6.0) and could not grow in media with ≥ 1 % NaCl (optimum 0 % NaCl). It utilized Fe(III), thiosulfate or l-cystine as electron acceptor for growth, and yeast extract, peptone or a variety of sugars as carbon and energy sources. The major cellular fatty acid was C16 : 0, and no lipoquinone was detected. Strain NAS-01T contained phospholipids and glycolipids, but not aminolipids. The DNA G+C content was 41.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was included in the phylum Thermotogae, and was closely related to Mesoaciditoga lauensis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between them was 90 %, and they were deeply branched off the rest of the known Thermotogae species. On the basis of the phylogenetic and ecophysiological properties, strain NAS-01T represents a novel species of a new genus in the phylum Thermotogae, for which we propose the name Athalassotoga saccharophila gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of the type species is NAS-01T ( = JCM 19762T = DSM 28954T).

The polar lipids of the strain consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, six unidentified aminophospholipids, three unidentified phospholipids, six unidentified lipids and a glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 65.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate formed a distinct lineage with Dongia mobilis and Dongia rigui within the family Rhodospirillaceae , but with a low sequence similarity of 92.7 and 92.0 %, respectively. On the basis of phylogenetic, phenotypic, physiological and chemotaxonomic distinctiveness, strain 7M-Z19T should be placed in the family Rhodospirillaceae as a representative of a novel genus and species, for which the name Aliidongia dinghuensis gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed.

		"abstract": "Core Ideas Biomass removal trials targeted soils sensitive to nutrient removal (shallow to bedrock and infertile sands). 14 long-term sites (42 plots per treatment) were used to evaluate C and nutrient reserves 20 years post-harvest. After 20 years, soil C, N, and K reserves did not differ between pre-harvest levels and SO and FT. Soil reserves of FTB treatments remained significantly lower than the pre-harvest levels. Jack pine and black spruce declined in height on FTB on sandy sites; there were no differences between SO and FT. Here we report on 20-yr soil (forest floor plus the upper 20 cm of mineral soil) carbon and nutrient reserves from 14 biomass removal trials established on coarse-textured, nutrient poor sites. Harvest treatments included stem only (SO, delimbed at the stump), full-tree (FT, entire trees with boles and branches removed), and full-tree plus forest floor blading (FTB, full-tree harvest followed by removal of the forest floor and approximately the upper 5 cm of mineral soil). After 20 yr, there were no significant differences in soil C, N, and K reserves between pre-harvest levels and the SO and FT treatments. Only the soil reserves of the FTB treatment remained significantly lower than the pre-harvest levels. Extractable soil Ca and Mg reserves increased in Year 5 in all treatments, followed by slow declines, but all treatments remained comparable to or exceeded pre-harvest levels at Year 20. For P, harvesting (SO and FT) resulted in significant declines that remain after 20 yr. Both jack pine and black spruce showed reduced top height growth on FTB, but only on some of the sandy sites. There were no differences in top height for either species between SO and FT across all 14 study sites. Current results suggest there is no need for restrictions on full-tree harvesting for traditional wood products on these nutrient poor sites. However, from a cautionary perspective, it seems prudent at this time to restrict more intensive bioenergy harvests to deep, finer-textured sites that have larger soil C and nutrient reserves.",

We establish 56 new species based on 165 cultures, differential interference contrast microscopy, and 18S and ITS2 rDNA sequencing, and a new genus Cavernomonas studied by scanning electron microscopy. We fundamentally revise the phylogeny and classification of cercomonad Cercozoa. We describe 40 Cercomonas species (35 novel), six Eocercomonas (five novel), two Cavernomonas, and 18 Paracercomonas species (14 novel). We obtained additional cercomonad clade A (Cercomonas, Eocercomonas, Cavernomonas) sequences from multiple environmental DNA libraries. The most commonly cultivated genotypes are not the commonest in environmental DNA, suggesting that cercomonad ecology is far more complex than implied by laboratory cultures. Cercomonads have never been isolated from saline environments, although some species can grow in semi-saline media in the laboratory, and environmental DNA libraries regularly detect them in coastal marine sediments. The first ultrastructural study of an anaerobic cercozoan, Paracercomonas anaerobica sp. nov., a highly divergent cercomonad, shows much simpler ciliary roots than in clade A cercomonads, a ciliary hub-lattice and axosome, and mitochondria with tubular cristae, consistent with it being only facultatively anaerobic. We also describe Agitata tremulans gen. et sp. nov., previously misidentified as Cercobodo (=Dimastigamoeba) agilis Moroff.",

		"abstract": "Soil pH is probably the most important variable explaining bacterial richness and community composition locally as well as globally. In contrast, pH effects on fungi appear to be less pronounced, but also less studied. Here we analyze the community responses of bacteria and fungi in parallel over a local extreme pH gradient ranging from 4 to 8. We established the pH gradient by applying strongly alkaline wood ash in dosages of 0, 3, 9, 15, 30, and 90 t ha–1 to replicated plots in a Picea abies plantation and assessed bacterial and fungal community composition using high throughput amplicon sequencing 1 year after ash application. At the same time, the experiment investigated if returning wood ash to plantation forests pose any immediate threats for the microbial communities. Among the measured environmental parameters, pH was by far the major driver of the microbial communities, however, bacterial and fungal communities responded differently to the pH increment. Whereas both bacterial and fungal communities showed directional changes correlated with the wood ash-induced increase in pH, the bacterial community displayed large changes at wood ash dosages of 9 and 15 t ha–1 while only higher dosages (>30 t ha–1) significantly changed the fungal community. The results confirm that fungi are less sensitive to pH changes than bacteria but also that fertilizing plantation forests with wood ash, viewed through the lens of microbial community changes, is a safe management at standard dosages (typically 3 t ha–1).",

		"abstract": "The use of biofuels has been proposed as one possible substitute for fossil fuels, which contribute substantially to the increase in [CO$_2$] in the atmosphere. However, increased harvesting of forest residues for biofuel might affect the availability of base cations, P and N, as well as the development, community dynamics and function of ectomycorrhizas. This in turn might influence nutrient uptake and tree growth. In this study we investigated the effects of repeated forest residue harvesting on ectomycorrhizal species colonizing spruce roots in the humus layer of a 35-yr-old forest. Harvesting significantly decreased the thickness of the humus layer as well as decreasing the numbers of ectomycorrhizal root tips both per metre root length and per unit humus volume. Changes in mycorrhizal community structure were studied by ITS typing with the use of PCR-RFLP analysis. In total, 19 different ITS types were found on two different sampling occasions (autumn and spring); 11 of these were common to both samplings. Nine of the ITS types were identified to at least the genus level by comparison with RFLP patterns of identified fruiting bodies or axenic cultures. Five species, Cortinarius sp. 2, Thelephora terrestris (Ehrenb.) Fr., Lactarius theiogalus (Bull. :Fr.) S. F. Gray s.st. Neuhoff, Tylosporafibrillosa Donk and To-96-12, occurred on over 5% of the total sampled root tips. Together these five types colonized 63% of the mycorrhizas screened. A similarity index assessment showed no shift in mycorrhizal community structure as a result of harvesting. Our findings suggest that the repeated removal of forest residues might have a strong effect on the quantity and development of ectomycorrhizal roots in the organic horizon, but little effect on the species composition of the community.",

		"abstract": "The increased demand for harvesting energy wood raises questions about its effects on the functioning of the forest ecosystems, soil processes and biodiversity. Impacts of tree stump removal on ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities of Norway spruce saplings were studied with 454-pyrosequencing in a 3-year field experiment replicated in 3 geographical areas. This is possibly the most thorough investigation of EMF communities associated with saplings grown on sites subjected to energy wood harvesting. To separate impacts of tree stump and logging residue removal on EMF and plant variables, we used three harvesting treatments with increasing complexity from patch mounding alone (P) to patch mounding combined with logging residue removal (RP), and patch mounding combined with both logging residue and stump removal (SRP). Saplings grown in uncut forests (F) served as references for harvesting treatments. A majority of sequences (>92%) and operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 55%) were assigned as EMF. EMF OTU richness, fungal community composition or sapling growth did not differ between harvesting treatments (P, RP and SRP), while EMF OTU richness, diversity and evenness were highest and sapling growth lowest in the undisturbed reference forests (F). The short study period may partially explain the similarities in fungal and sapling variables in different harvesting treatments. In conclusion, our results indicate that neither stump removal nor logging residue removal have significant additional negative impacts on EMF communities or growth of Norway spruce saplings in the short-term compared with the impacts of more conventional harvesting methods, including clear cutting and patch mounding.",

		"abstract": "Fennoscandian forestry has in the past decades changed from natural regeneration of forests towards replantation of clear-cuts, which negatively impacts ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) diversity. Retention of trees during harvesting enables EMF survival, and we therefore expected EMF communities to be more similar to those in old natural stands after forest regeneration using seed trees compared to full clear-cutting and replanting. We sequenced fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicons to assess EMF communities in 10- to 60-year-old Scots pine stands regenerated either using seed trees or through replanting of clear-cuts with old natural stands as reference. We also investigated local EMF communities around retained old trees. We found that retention of seed trees failed to mitigate the impact of harvesting on EMF community composition and diversity. With increasing stand age, EMF communities became increasingly similar to those in old natural stands and permanently retained trees maintained EMF locally. From our observations, we conclude that EMF communities, at least common species, post-harvest are more influenced by environmental filtering, resulting from environmental changes induced by harvest, than by the continuity of trees. These results suggest that retention of intact forest patches is a more efficient way to conserve EMF diversity than retaining dispersed single trees.",

		"abstract": "Land-use intensification can lead to taxonomic and/or functional homogenization of biotic communities, with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. In boreal forests, managers are increasingly considering intensifying woody biomass removal for bioenergy, but associated functional effects on soil fauna that use microhabitats associated with this biomass remain poorly understood. Two years after harvesting, we assessed the effects of an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal in a northeastern Ontario jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stand on the functional structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities, two abundant soil taxa. The gradient ranged from (1) uncut forest to (2) stem-only harvesting to intense biomass removal through (3) whole-tree harvesting (stem, top and branches) with (4) stump removal and (5) additional removal of organic soil strata. Morphological and life-history response traits associated with hypothesized functions were measured to determine changes in the functional structure (species trait diversity and composition) of communities in response to the gradient and related environmental changes. We found that functional structure of communities of both taxa was overall significantly modified by biomass removal through a compositional shift in species traits in comparison to uncut forest. Functional homogenization was observed for Oribatida communities with a loss of species that were surface-dwelling, larger, predominantly sexually reproducing and mostly micro-detritivorous. In contrast, Collembola communities were less affected with only the most extreme treatment showing a more homogenized community than the uncut forest. These functional changes were mainly explained by fewer suitable microhabitats, characterized for example by a more stable microclimate as well as more abundant and diverse food resources, due to the disturbance of forest floor organic cover with harvesting. To improve sustainable management of boreal forests, long-term studies will be needed to assess if partial functional homogenization of soil mesofauna by intensive practices persists through time and may influence soil ecosystem function.",

		"abstract": "The degree and extent of soil compaction, which may reduce productivity of forest soils, is believed to vary by the type of harvesting system, and a field-based study was conducted to compare soil compaction from cut-to-length (CTL) and whole-tree (WT) harvesting operations. The CTL harvesting system used less area to transport logs to the landings than did the WT harvesting system (19%–20% vs. 24%–25%). At high soil moisture levels (25%–30%), both CTL and WT harvestings caused a significant increase of soil resistance to penetration (SRP) and bulk density (BD) in the track compared with the undisturbed area (p < 0.05). In the center of trails, however, only WT harvesting resulted in a significant increase of SRP and BD compared with the undisturbed area (p < 0.05). Slash covered 69% of the forwarding trail area in the CTL harvesting units; 37% was covered by heavy slash (40 kg·m–2) while 32% was covered by light slash (7.3 kg·m–2). Heavy slash was more effective in reducing soil compaction in the CTL units (p < 0.05). Prediction models were developed that can be used to estimate percent increases in SRP and BD over undisturbed areas for both CTL and WT harvesting systems.",

		"abstract": "Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.",

		"abstract": "Increasing interest in renewable fuels inspired a three-day workshop in Toronto in February 2008, entitled: The Scientific Foundation for Sustainable Forest Biomass Harvesting Guidelines and Policy. In this paper, we summarized the biodiversity-focused content of the workshop, including potential implications of intensification of biomass removal on biodiversity, knowledge gaps identified by workshop participants, and implications for policy development. Woody debris represents an important habitat resource for a wide variety of forest organisms, and the presence and continued supply of fresh to highly decayed dead wood represents a key concern in managed forest systems. A key challenge in sustainable forests management is to determine to what extent biomass harvests can increase fibre use while sustaining biodiversity, its functions, and the broad suite of ecosystem services that it provides. For knowledge-based planning and policy development, researchers must provide complex information to policy-makers and forest managers in a clear, effective way. In particular, full life-cycle analysis of intensive forest biomass harvesting taking into account environmental consequences is needed to inform sound evidence-based policy and decision-making. In the absence of complete scientific information, forest managers and decision-makers are well-advised to proceed with caution within a well-developed adaptive management framework.",

		"abstract": "Despite an exceptional number of bacterial cells and species in soils, bacterial diversity seems to have little effect on soil processes, such as respiration or nitrification, that can be affected by interactions between bacterial cells. The aim of this study is to understand how bacterial cells are distributed in soil to better understand the scaling between cell-to-cell interactions and what can be measured in a few milligrams, or more, of soil. Based on the analysis of 744 images of observed bacterial distributions in soil thin sections taken at different depths, we found that the inter-cell distance was, on average 12.46 µm and that these inter-cell distances were shorter near the soil surface (10.38 µm) than at depth (>18 µm), due to changes in cell densities. These images were also used to develop a spatial statistical model, based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes, to analyse the 2D distribution of cells and construct realistic 3D bacterial distributions. Our analyses suggest that despite the very high number of cells and species in soil, bacteria only interact with a few other individuals. For example, at bacterial densities commonly found in bulk soil (108 cells g−1 soil), the number of neighbours a single bacterium has within an interaction distance of ca. 20 µm is relatively limited (120 cells on average). Making conservative assumptions about the distribution of species, we show that such neighbourhoods contain less than 100 species. This value did not change appreciably as a function of the overall diversity in soil, suggesting that the diversity of soil bacterial communities may be species-saturated. All in all, this work provides precise data on bacterial distributions, a novel way to model them at the micrometer scale as well as some new insights on the degree of interactions between individual bacterial cells in soils.",

Understanding the possible eﬀects of silvicultural site preparation on the ecosystem and evaluating site preparation as an ecological disturbance can help guide the selection and application of site preparation techniques for forest management goals. This review evaluates silvicultural site preparation techniques that are commonly used in boreal mixedwood ecosystems as agents of ecological disturbance by comparing the eﬀects of each technique on the area disturbed and the degree of biomass modiﬁcation, and then ordering them along a disturbance severity gradient. With a strong emphasis on the numerical estimation of the spatial footprint of diﬀerent disturbances, broadcast burning typically has the highest disturbance severity, followed in order by broadcast herbicide use, mixing, plowing, disc trenching, mounding, scalping, and inverting. The evaluation of disturbance severity of various silvicultural site preparation techniques while using the proposed framework is feasible, in which quantitative assessments of area disturbed and biomass modiﬁcation could be collected and assessed in most managed forests.",

		"abstract": "Soil microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi play important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of soil nutrients, because they act as decomposers or are mutualistic or antagonistic symbionts, thereby influencing plant growth and health. In the present study, we investigated the vertical distribution of the soil microbiome to a depth of 2 m in Swiss drought-exposed forests of European beech and oaks on calcareous bedrock. We aimed to disentangle the effects of soil depth, tree (beech, oak), and substrate (soil, roots) on microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure. With increasing soil depth, organic carbon, nitrogen, and clay content decreased significantly. Similarly, fine root biomass, microbial biomass (DNA content, fungal abundance), and microbial alpha-diversity decreased and were consequently significantly related to these physicochemical parameters. In contrast, bacterial abundance tended to increase with soil depth, and the bacteria to fungi ratio increased significantly with greater depth. Tree species was only significantly related to the fungal Shannon index but not to the bacterial Shannon index. Microbial community analyses revealed that bacterial and fungal communities varied significantly across the soil layers, more strongly for bacteria than for fungi. Both communities were also significantly affected by tree species and substrate. In deep soil layers, poorly known bacterial taxa from Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Rokubacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes and GAL 15 were overrepresented. Furthermore, archaeal phyla such as Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were more abundant in subsoils than topsoils. Fungal taxa that were predominantly found in deep soil layers belong to the ectomycorrhizal Boletus luridus and Hydnum vesterholtii. Both taxa are reported for the first time in such deep soil layers. Saprotrophic fungal taxa predominantly recorded in deep soil layers were unknown species of Xylaria. Finally, our results show that the microbial community structure found in fine roots was well represented in the bulk soil. Overall, we recorded poorly known bacterial and archaeal phyla, as well as ectomycorrhizal fungi that were not previously known to colonize deep soil layers. Our study contributes to an integrated perspective on the vertical distribution of the soil microbiome at a fine spatial scale in drought-exposed forests.",

		"abstract": "1. Biodiversity, water quality and ecosystem processes in streams are known to be influenced by the terrestrial landscape over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Lumped attributes (i.e. per cent land use) are often used to characterise the condition of the catchment; however, they are not spatially explicit and do not account for the disproportionate influence of land located near the stream or connected by overland flow. 2. We compared seven landscape representation metrics to determine whether accounting for the spatial proximity and hydrological effects of land use can be used to account for additional variability in indicators of stream ecosystem health. The landscape metrics included the following: a lumped metric, four inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) metrics based on distance to the stream or survey site and two modified IDW metrics that also accounted for the level of hydrologic activity (HA-IDW). Ecosystem health data were obtained from the Ecological Health Monitoring Programme in Southeast Queensland, Australia and included measures of fish, invertebrates, physicochemistry and nutrients collected during two seasons over 4 years. Linear models were fitted to the stream indicators and landscape metrics, by season, and compared using an information-theoretic approach. 3. Although no single metric was most suitable for modelling all stream indicators, lumped metrics rarely performed as well as other metric types. Metrics based on proximity to the stream (IDW and HA-IDW) were more suitable for modelling fish indicators, while the HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the survey site generally outperformed others for invertebrates, irrespective of season. There was consistent support for metrics based on proximity to the survey site (IDW or HA-IDW) for all physicochemical indicators during the dry season, while a HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the stream was suitable for five of the six physicochemical indicators in the post-wet season. Only one nutrient indicator was tested and results showed that catchment area had a significant effect on the relationship between land use metrics and algal stable isotope ratios in both seasons. 4. Spatially explicit methods of landscape representation can clearly improve the predictive ability of many empirical models currently used to study the relationship between landscape, habitat and stream condition. A comparison of different metrics may provide clues about causal pathways and mechanistic processes behind correlative relationships and could be used to target restoration efforts strategically.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we describe how forest management practices in Fennoscandian countries, namely Sweden and Finland, expose streams to multiple stressors over space and time. In this region, forestry includes several different management actions and we explore how these may successively disturb the same location over 60–100 year long rotation periods. Of these actions, final harvest and associated road construction, soil scarification, and/or ditch network maintenance are the most obvious sources of stressors to aquatic ecosystems. Yet, more subtle actions such as planting, thinning of competing saplings and trees, and removing logging residues also represent disturbances around waterways in these landscapes. We review literature about how these different forestry practices may introduce a combination of physicochemical stressors, including hydrological change, increased sediment transport, altered thermal and light regimes, and water quality deterioration. We further elaborate on how the single stressors may combine and interact and we consequently hypothesise how these interactions may affect aquatic communities and processes. Because production forestry is practiced on a large area in both countries, the various stressors appear multiple times during the rotation cycles and potentially affect the majority of the stream network length within most catchments. We concluded that forestry practices have traditionally not been the focus of multiple stressor studies and should be investigated further in both observational and experimental fashion. Stressors accumulate across time and space in forestry dominated landscapes, and may interact in unpredictable ways, limiting our current understanding of what forested stream networks are exposed to and how we can design and apply best management practices.",

		"abstract": "Nutrient availability is an important constraint on sustainable forest productivity, and it is crucial to understand the long-term effects of management practices, including soil scarification, on soil microbial communities because they store and cycle nutrients. In addition, because forests are subject to wildfires, it would be useful to understand potential interactive effects of wildfire and management practice on forest soil ecosystems. We studied the individual and combined effects of soil scarification and a subsequent wildfire on microbial community structure of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson) forest soil in the central Rocky Mountains. Experimental plots were scarified by rototilling in 1981, and in 2002, some of the plots were burned during a mixed-severity wildfire. In 2005, mineral soil samples (0–10-cm depth) were collected and assayed for soil chemical properties, fungal and bacterial biomass, C mineralization potential, and microbial community fatty acid composition. Compared with undisturbed soil, soil from scarified-only plots was relatively high in pH, low in total C and organic matter (OM) concentrations, low in fungal and bacterial biomass, and enriched with Gram-positive biomarkers. Regardless of scarification treatment, soil from burned plots was relatively high in pH and extractable P, low in fungal but not bacterial biomass, and enriched with Gram-negative bacterial biomarkers. Compared with scarified-only plots, scarified-plus-burned plots had greater soil C and OM concentrations. Carbon mineralization rates were not different among the plot soils. While scarification is a positive practice for aiding seedling establishment, we found long-term effects on soil C reserves and microbial communities.",

		"abstract": "Leaf-litter decomposition and associated macroinvertebrate communities were compared in standardized leaf packs across forest streams in recently clearcut (n = 9) and reference (n = 12) low-order catchments on the Boreal Shield in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Logging was conducted under best management practices that included application of 30- to 100-m-wide no-harvest buffer zones on both sides of each stream. No significant differences were detected between sites in logged and reference streams for any reach- or catchment-level characteristics (except % area logged) or water-quality variables. Coarse-mesh leaf-pack mass loss was significantly lower (t-test, p = 0.003), and the ratio of fine-mesh to coarse-mesh leaf-pack mass loss was significantly higher (t-test, p = 0.008) in logged than in reference streams, but no difference in fine-mesh leaf-pack mass loss was detected between logged and reference streams. A stepwise multiple regression model of coarse-mesh leaf-pack mass loss on 15 reach- and catchment-level characteristics indicated that only logging presence/absence (r = −0.524) and average reach velocity (r = 0.397) were significantly and independently associated with leaf-litter decomposition. Macroinvertebrate communities on leaf packs in logged streams were different from those in reference streams. Taxonomic richness was significantly lower in logged than in reference streams. A multivariate ordination and analysis of similarity separated logged from reference streams, and abundances of the 3 most discriminating taxa were significantly lower in logged than in reference streams. A multivariate BVSTEP routine indicated that macroinvertebrate community structure was most strongly associated with logging presence/absence among the suite of site characteristics. Leaf-litter decomposition and aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure were successful bioindicators of catchment logging impacts, even when logging was conducted under best management practices. Effects on litter decomposition and leaf-pack macroinvertebrate communities seem to have been caused by upland logging disturbances because riparian areas were undisturbed in logged catchments.",

Because phenotypic identification is expert-limited, a shift towards DNA metabarcoding could improve scalability and democratize the use of forest floor arthropods for biomonitoring applications. The objective of this study was to establish the level of field sampling and DNA extraction replication needed for arthropod biodiversity assessments from soil. Processing 15 individually collected soil samples recovered significantly higher median richness (488–614 sequence variants) than pooling the same number of samples (165–191 sequence variants) prior to DNA extraction, and we found no significant richness differences when using 1 or 3 pooled DNA extractions. Beta diversity was robust to changes in methodological regimes. Though our ability to identify taxa to species rank was limited, we were able to use arthropod COI metabarcodes from forest soil to assess richness, distinguish among sites, and recover site indicators based on unnamed exact sequence variants. Our results highlight the need to continue DNA barcoding local taxa during COI metabarcoding studies to help build reference databases. All together, these sampling considerations support the use of soil arthropod COI metabarcoding as a scalable method for biomonitoring.",

Due to difficulties in isolation and long-term maintenance, most of these are still poorly known. In this study stable, bacteria-free cultures of several limnetic, algivorous amoeboflagellates were investigated by light microscopy and molecular phylogenetic analyses. All strains represent naked, biflagellate cells, either occurring as rigid flagellates or as surface-attached amoebae. They perforate cell walls of certain Zygnematophyceae and Chlorophyceae (Viridiplantae) and phagocytose algal cell contents. Time-lapse microscopy revealed the feeding behaviour, locomotional processes and life histories of the amoeboflagellates. Clear differences in cell morphology and food range specificity led to the description of two new, monotypic genera Orciraptor and Viridiraptor, which occupy similar, but distinct ecological niches in aquatic ecosystems as 'necrophytophagous' and 'parasitoid' protists, respectively. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rDNA sequence data demonstrated that Orciraptor and Viridiraptor belonged to 'clade X' within the order Glissomonadida (Cercozoa, Rhizaria). In conclusion, we established the phenotypic identity of a clade, which until now was exclusively known from environmental sequences, and erect the new family Viridiraptoridae for 'clade X'. Its algivorous members are compared with other glissomonads and nomenclatural, methodological and ecological aspects of these novel 'raptorial' amoeboflagellates are discussed.",

Disc trenching is an important silvicultural management tool for creating microsites to ensure the survival and growth of newly planted seedlings. Mounded microsites are thought to be a source of nutrients for seedling roots; however, little is known concerning how nutrients are redistributed in the soil after disc trenching. The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine the redistribution of soil horizons and selected soil chemical properties following Delta disc trenching. Three sites were selected on both Luvisol and Brunisol soils in northern Saskatchewan. Soil profiles were excavated and samples collected from 15 × 15 cm grids to a 1-m depth. Samples were analyzed for pH and extractable nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and sulfur (S). Disc trenching concentrated extractable N, P and S in the berm microsite compared to the trench microsites. The redistribution of extractable NO3, NH4 and P in the berms compared to the trench microsites was 20 times greater for Luvisol sites compared to the Brunisol sites, while extractable K and S were similar between both microsites for each soil. Seedlings planted on these mounded microsites therefore should have a large pool of nutrients for plant growth; however, further work is needed to determine patterns of nutrient uptake by seedlings in relation to mounded and trench microsites.",

Broadcast burning had virtually no effect on either the bulk density or chemical properties of soil. In contrast, significant reductions in soil bulk density and increases in soil nutrient availability persisted for 20 years in hinge position soils relative to undisturbed (control) soil between trenches. These effects on bulk density and nutrient availability are associated with significant differences in pine size by year 6. Burning and planting positions interacted significantly in their effect on pine height, diameter, and stem volume for at least 19 years. Pine survival was high regardless of burning or planting position. Neither broadcast burning nor planting position significantly affected lodgepole pine foliar nutrient status in this study.",

MSP also promotes the establishment and growth of tree seedlings, and hence ecosystem C fixation. However, there are uncertainties regarding the net effects of MSP on C stocks at the ecosystem scale. To assess decennial effects of MSP on ecosystem C stocks, C stocks in soil, ground vegetation and trees at three experimental forest sites with Pinus contorta, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in Sweden were sampled and measured for ca. 25 years in a control and after three MSP treatments: disc trenching, mounding and ploughing. After 25 years, all of the MSP treatments resulted in larger ecosystem C stocks than the control treatment due to positive effects on the tree biomass C stock. The tree C stock was highest after ploughing, intermediate after mounding or disc trenching and lowest in untreated control plo...",

		"abstract": "The effects of soil disturbance on the nematode community were assessed at 30 sites on the outer coastal plain of Mississippi, representing four ages since soil disturbance plus a control group of six undisturbed sites. Thirty-five taxa were encountered, dominated in abundance and taxonomic richness by plant and bacterial feeders. Nematodes were more abundant and more taxonomically rich in sites with a low slope and deep litter cover, distant from trees. Plant feeders were more numerous at sites with a dense herb cover, suggesting limitation by food availability. When sites were arranged as a chronosequence, herb cover, litter depth, soil organic matter, soil moisture, and tree canopy cover increased through time consistent with succession to forest. The abundance of most trophic groups decreased in the 10 to 20 years following disturbance and increased thereafter, a pattern repeated in taxonomic richness of plant and bacterial feeders. Fifty years after disturbance, nematode abundance had not returned to levels observed in control sites. These results suggest that nematode succession following soil disturbance is a gradual process regulated by establishment of aboveground vegetation. There was no evidence of dispersal limitation or facilitation by colonist nematode species.",

In soil 1, chipped woody debris had been spread on the top soil and mixed with the soil by standard deep ploughing to 50 cm. In soil 2, woody debris was removed and there was no ground preparation. Ten years later, the different methods of management resulted in unexpectedly distinctive habitat heterogeneity with a high variation in structure of the mycobiota communities. Incorporation of woody debris into soil resulted in lower abundance of fungi but greater fungal diversity (which may enhance ecosystem stability) and was beneficial for the growth of Scots pines. Removal of post-harvest woody debris from the surface of the clear-cut site with no subsequent ground preparation, compared with incorporating chipped debris and deep ploughing, resulted in the soil of the subsequent 10-year-old Scots pine plantation having: (a) 159-fold greater abundance of fungi, (b) lower fungal diversity, (c) different fungal community composition, (d) higher proportion of mycorrhizal fungi, (e) no root rot pathogens, (f) less tree biomass. The study showed that removal of post-harvest woody debris and no ground preparation is potentially beneficial for the health of young coniferous trees.",

		"abstract": "Nitrogen (N) fertilization and mechanical site preparation are used to increase productivity of forests and prevent paludification in wet climates. However, these practices may also alter soil microbial community structure and rates of decomposition and respiration. The effects of mounding, drainage and fertilization were investigated at a mounded hybrid spruce site and a drained coastal western redcedar – western hemlock site in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada. CO2 efflux was measured at four dates over a one-year period using static closed chambers. Total bacterial and fungal ribosomal marker abundance and structure were assessed using quantitative PCR and terminal-restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), respectively. Mounding reduced soil water content of planting sites, but also removed much of the forest floor layer from the rooting zone and led to a significant decrease in CO2 efflux rates, as well as bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity. Drainage increased CO2 fluxes and led to significant differences in T-RFLP profiles in drained and undrained samples. Fertilization had variable effects on the microbial community and CO2 fluxes at the two sites. Site preparation and fertilization can improve regeneration of wet forests that would otherwise be subject to paludification, but can lead to shifts in carbon fluxes and microbial community structure. Major disturbances to soil structure and composition (e.g., following mounding) can alter the microbial community structure in a way that suppresses microbial diversity and function for up to one year following treatment.",

		"abstract": "Industrial forest managers and conservation biologists agree on at least two things: (1) plantation forests can play a role in conserving biodiversity, and (2) plantations will occupy an increasing proportion of future landscapes. I review literature from around the world on the relationship between biodiversity and plantation management, structure, and yield. The dynamics of plantation ecology and management necessarily differ by landscape, geographic area, ecosystem type, etc. This review provides a broad array of management recommendations, most of which apply to most regions, and many patterns are evident. I suggest a new plantation forest paradigm based on the hypothesis that minor improvements in design and management can better conserve biodiversity, often with little or no reduction in fiber production. There is ample evidence that these methods do benefit biodiversity, and can also entail various economic benefits. Adherence to these recommendations should vary by plantation type, and depending on the proportion of the surrounding landscape or region that is or will be planted. Stand-level variables to consider include socio-economic factors, native community type and structure, crop species composition, and pest dynamics. During establishment, managers should consider innovations in snag and reserve tree management (e.g. leave strips), where mature native trees and/or understory vegetation are left unharvested or allowed to regenerate. Polycultures should be favored over monocultures by planting multiple crop species and/or leaving some native trees unharvested. Native species should generally be favored over exotics. Site-preparation should favor methods that reflect natural disturbances and conserve coarse woody debris. Plantations that have already been established by traditional design can also conserve biodiversity via small modifications to operations. Earlier thinning schedules or longer rotations can strongly affect biodiversity, as can reserve trees left after plantation harvest to remain through a second rotation.",

		"abstract": "Seagrasses are marine ﬂowering plants that provide critical ecosystem services in coastal environments worldwide. Marine fungi are often overlooked in microbiome and seagrass studies, despite terrestrial fungi having critical functional roles as decomposers, pathogens, or endophytes in global ecosystems. Here, we characterize the distribution of fungi associated with the seagrass Zostera marina, using leaves, roots, and rhizosphere sediment from 16 locations across its full biogeographic range. Using high-throughput sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 18S rRNA gene, we ﬁrst measured fungal community composition and diversity. We then tested hypotheses of neutral community assembly theory and the degree to which deviations suggested that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were plant selected or dispersal limited. Finally, we identiﬁed a core mycobiome and investigated the global distribution of differentially abundant ASVs. We found that the fungal community is signiﬁcantly different between sites and that the leaf mycobiome follows a weak but signiﬁcant pattern of distance decay in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Generally, there was evidence for both deterministic and stochastic factors contributing to community assembly of the mycobiome, with most taxa assembling through stochastic processes. The Z. marina core leaf and root mycobiomes were dominated by unclassiﬁed Sordariomycetes spp., unclassiﬁed Chytridiomycota lineages (including Lobulomycetaceae spp.), unclassiﬁed Capnodiales spp., and Saccharomyces sp. It is clear from the many unclassiﬁed fungal ASVs and fungal functional guilds that knowledge of marine fungi is still rudimentary. Further studies characterizing seagrass-associated fungi are needed to understand the roles of these microorganisms generally and when associated with seagrasses.",

CoDA has only been sparsely applied to NGS data generated from microbial communities or to multiple ‘omics’ datasets. In this study, we applied CoDA methods to analyze NGS and untargeted metabolomic datasets obtained from bacterial and fungal communities. Specifically, we used clr transformation to reanalyze NGS amplicon and metabolomics data from a study investigating the effects of building material type, moisture and time on microbial and metabolomic diversity. Compared to analysis of untransformed data, analysis of clr-transformed data revealed novel relationships and stronger associations between sample conditions and microbial and metabolic community profiles.",

		"abstract": "Explicitly representing microbial processes has been recognized as a key improvement to Earth system models for the realistic projections of soil carbon (C) and climate dynamics. The CLM-Microbe model builds upon the CLM4.5 and explicitly represents two major soil microbial groups, fungi and bacteria. Based on the compiled time-series data of fungal (FBC) and bacterial (BBC) biomass C from nine biomes, we parameterized and validated the CLM-Microbe model, and further conducted sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for simulating C cycling. The model performance was evaluated with mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) for relative change in FBC and BBC. The CLM-Microbe model is able to reasonably capture the seasonal dynamics of FBC and BBC across biomes, particularly for tropical/subtropical forest, temperate broadleaf forest, and grassland, with MAE <0.49 for FBC and <0.36 for BBC and RMSE <0.52 FBC and <0.39 for BBC, while R2 values are relatively smaller in some biomes (e.g., shrub) due to small sample sizes. We found good consistencies between simulated and observed FBC (R2 = 0.70, P < 0.001) and BBC (R2 = 0.26, P < 0.05) on average across biomes, but the model is not able to fully capture the large variation in observed FBC and BBC. Sensitivity analysis shows that the most critical parameters are turnover rate and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of fungi and bacteria and microbial assimilation efficiency. This study confirms that the explicit representation of soil microbial mechanisms enhances model performance in simulating C variables such as heterotrophic respiration and soil organic C density. The further application of the CLM-Microbe model would deepen our understanding of microbial contributions to global C cycle.",

		"abstract": "Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed scientists to probe increasingly complex biological systems, including the diversity of bacteria in the environment. However, despite a multitude of recent studies incorporating these methods, many questions regarding how environmental samples should be collected and stored still persist. Here, we assess the impact of different soil storage conditions on microbial community composition using Illumina-based 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing. Both storage time and temperature affected bacterial community composition and structure. Frozen samples maintained the highest alpha diversity and differed least in beta diversity, suggesting the utility of cold storage for maintaining consistent communities. Samples stored for intermediate times (three and seven days) had both the highest alpha diversity and the largest differences in overall beta diversity, showing the degree of community change after sample collection. These divergences notwithstanding, differences in neither storage time nor storage temperature substantially altered overall communities relative to more than 500 previously examined soil samples. These results systematically support previous studies and stress the importance of methodological consistency for accurate characterization and comparison of soil microbiological assemblages.",

		"abstract": "Soil microbes are essential functional components in soil ecosystems, involved in diverse biogeochemical processes. Storage of soil samples for soil microbial community analysis is sometimes inevitable because of large quantity of samples. The effects of storage on soil microbial community, however, is less revealed, especially using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and community level physiological proﬁling (CLPP), the most widely used techniques for microbial ecology. We stored forest land (FL) soils and arable land (AL) soils at 4  C after air drying (AirDrying) or at À20  C with ﬁeld moisture (Freezing) for two month, and then the microbial community structures and metabolic activities in the stored soils were compared to those in the fresh soils, using PCR-DGGE proﬁling and Biolog® microplate. Similarity coefﬁcients indicate that both storage methods shifted microbial community structure depending on soil types and microbial types. Microbial community in AL soils is more stable than that in FL soils, and fungal community is more stable than bacterial community. Freezing changed microbial community less than AirDrying based on genetic ﬁngerprinting, however, microbial metabolic activity was greatly decreased by both storage methods. Our results suggest that, fresh soils are the best choice if microbial metabolic activity is under investigation while freezing at À20  C for less than two months is acceptable if microbial community is studied on the basis of genetic ﬁngerprinting.",

		"abstract": "Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.",

		"abstract": "With the advances of sequencing tools, the fields of environmental microbiology and soil ecology have been transformed. Today, the unculturable majority of soil microbes can be sequenced. Although these tools give us tremendous power and open many doors to answer important questions, we must understand how sample processing may impact our results and interpretations. Here, we test the impacts of four soil storage methods on downstream amplicon metabarcoding and qPCR analyses for fungi and bacteria. We further investigate the impact of thaw time on extracted DNA to determine a safe length of time during which this can occur with minimal impact on study results. Overall, we find that storage using standard cold packs with subsequent storage at −20°C is little different than immediate storage in liquid nitrogen, suggesting that the historical and current method is adequate. We further find evidence that storage at room temperature or with aid of RNAlater can lead to changes in community composition and in the case of RNAlater, lower gene copies. We therefore advise against these storage methods for metabarcoding analyses. Finally, we show that over 1 month, DNA extract thaw time does not impact diversity or qPCR metrics. We hope that this work will help researchers working with soil bacteria and fungi make informed decisions about soil storage and transport to ensure repeatability and accuracy of results and interpretations.",

Here we use shotgun metagenomics to rigorously evaluate the technical and compositional reproducibility of five room temperature (RT) microbial stabilisation methods compared to the best practice of flash-freezing. These methods included RNALater, OMNIGene-GUT, a dry BBL swab, LifeGuard, and a novel method for preserving faecal samples, a Copan FLOQSwab in an active drying tube (FLOQSwab-ADT). Each method was assessed using six replicate faecal samples from five participants, totalling 180 samples. The FLOQSwab-ADT performed best for both technical and compositional reproducibility, followed by RNAlater and OMNIgene-GUT. LifeGuard and the BBL swab had unpredictable outgrowth of\n              Escherichia\n              species in at least one replicate from each participant. We further evaluated the FLOQSwab-ADT in an additional 239 samples across 10 individuals after storage at −20 °C, RT, and 50 °C for four weeks compared to fresh controls. The FLOQSwab-ADT maintained its performance across all temperatures, indicating this method is an excellent alternative to existing RT stabilisation methods.",

		"abstract": "Immediate freezing at Ϫ20°C or below has been considered the gold standard for microbiome preservation, yet this approach is not feasible for many ﬁeld studies, ranging from anthropology to wildlife conservation. Here we tested ﬁve methods for preserving human and dog fecal specimens for periods of up to 8 weeks, including such types of variation as freeze-thaw cycles and the high temperature ﬂuctuations often encountered under ﬁeld conditions. We found that three of the methods—95% ethanol, FTA cards, and the OMNIgene Gut kit— can preserve samples sufﬁciently well at ambient temperatures such that differences at 8 weeks are comparable to differences among technical replicates. However, even the worst methods, including those with no ﬁxative, were able to reveal microbiome differences between species at 8 weeks and between individuals after a week, allowing meta-analyses of samples collected using various methods when the effect of interest is expected to be larger than interindividual variation (although use of a single method within a study is strongly recommended to reduce batch effects). Encouragingly for FTA cards, the differences caused by this method are systematic and can be detrended. As in other studies, we strongly caution against the use of 70% ethanol. The results, spanning 15 individuals and over 1,200 samples, provide our most comprehensive view to date of storage effects on stool and provide a paradigm for the future studies of other sample types that will be required to provide a global view of microbial diversity and its interaction among humans, animals, and the environment.",

		"abstract": "Prior to registration and commercialization, crop protection products (CPP) need to be tested for their environmental impact and fate. For fate studies, laboratory microcosm experiments are performed with deﬁned natural soils. Quality control of these soils represents a challenge, since it is often difﬁcult to obtain fresh soil and soil storage may affect soil characteristics. According to guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) frozen storage is recommended for periods exceeding three months. The present study was performed to investigate the inﬂuence of soil frozen storage on microbiological soil characteristics (MSCs) and CPP mineralization rates. For this purpose an agricultural soil was frozen for four days, thawed, and subsequently equilibrated and monitored during 42 days under controlled conditions. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rates increased shortly after thawing and returned to reference levels within ten days. Degradation of the CPP methidathion appeared unaffected in the soils that had been frozen. Conversely, we found that soil DNA contents and direct cell counts decreased by 24 and 22%, respectively, in the frozen stored soil. Impacts on soil microbial population structures were analyzed by use of domain-speciﬁc PCR of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes for Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea in conjunction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Since the Archaea community appeared most sensitive to the freezing stress, cloning and sequencing was performed to identify marker genes for freezing stress sensitive and resistant groups. Novel speciﬁc PCR detections were developed for a freezing stress resistant and a freezing stress sensitive group. These new tools allowed monitoring and comparison of archaeal population shifts without using RFLP analysis. Over all, the molecular biological approach revealed that the initial MSCs were not restored after 42 days equilibration of the frozen soil, even though SIR rates and mineralization of one speciﬁc CPP appeared unaffected. Our results demonstrate that speciﬁc molecular tools can identify sensitive indicators of altered MSCs and may be applied for the description of stress effects that can occur during soil storage.",

		"abstract": "Methods of preserving nucleic acids are increasingly in demand because of the recent advances in molecular and biochemical approaches to ecology. The RNA storage reagent RNAlater ® was tested as an alternative method to deep-freezing for preserving RNA and DNA in zooplankton. Artemia spp. nauplii were used as test organisms. Individual RNA and DNA contents were monitored over a time period of 8 months to evaluate the effects of preservation and storage. Treatments included (1) freezing at –80°C, (2) preservation with RNAlater, followed by storage at 5°C, and (3) preservation with RNAlater and storage at room temperature. Freezing at –80°C was the only treatment that did not result in significant change from the initial values in any of the nucleic acids, nor at any time of the experiment. At 5°C, significant RNA degradation was not observed until 8 months after preservation while no significant changes in DNA were detected. In samples stored in RNAlater without refrigeration, RNA did not exhibit significant decrease for at least 1 month, and DNA for at least 2 months. As RNA and DNA degraded at roughly the same rate, this resulted in little or no changes in RNA:DNA ratios, but withintreatment variability increased strongly. Thus, RNAlater successfully preserved both RNA and DNA for up to 1 month at room temperature, and up to 4 months at 5°C, providing an alternative to the deep freezing. This method will enable a greater integration of molecular methods in ecological studies.",

However, whether differences in shortterm sample storage conditions impact the assessment of bacterial community composition and diversity requires systematic and quantitative assessment. Therefore, we used barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to survey communities, harvested from a variety of habitats [soil, human gut (feces) and human skin] and subsequently stored at 20, 4, À 20 and À 80 1C for 3 and 14 days. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic structure and diversity of communities in individual samples were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the storage temperature or the duration of storage. Likewise, the relative abundances of most taxa were largely unaffected by temperature even after 14 days of storage. Our results indicate that environmental factors and biases in molecular techniques likely confer greater amounts of variation to microbial communities than do differences in short-term storage conditions, including storage for up to 2 weeks at room temperature. These results suggest that many samples collected and stored under ﬁeld conditions without refrigeration may be useful for microbial community analyses.",

However, laboratory and field evidence for the existence of these processes are rare. Piloderma sp., a common ECM genus in boreal forest soil, was chosen as model mycorrhiza for this study. The abundance of Piloderma sp. was studied in root tips and soil over one growing season and in winter. Protease production was measured from ectomycorrhiza and soil solution in the field and pure fungal cultures. We also tested the effect of Piloderma olivaceum on host plant organic N nutrition in the laboratory. The results showed that Piloderma sp. was highly abundant in the field and produced extracellular proteases, which correlated positively with the gross primary production, temperature and soil respiration. In the laboratory, Piloderma olivaceum could improve the ability of Pinus sylvestris L. to utilize N from extragenous proteins. We suggest that ECM fungi, although potentially retaining N in their hyphae, are important in forest C and N cycling due to their ability to access proteinaeous N. As Piloderma sp. abundance appeared to be seasonally highly variable, recycling of fungal-bound N after hyphal death may therefore be of primary importance for the N cycling in boreal ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Species of Trichocomaceae occur commonly and are important to both industry and medicine. They are associated with food spoilage and mycotoxin production and can occur in the indoor environment, causing health hazards by the formation of β-glucans, mycotoxins and surface proteins. Some species are opportunistic pathogens, while others are exploited in biotechnology for the production of enzymes, antibiotics and other products. Penicillium belongs phylogenetically to Trichocomaceae and more than 250 species are currently accepted in this genus. In this study, we investigated the relationship of Penicillium to other genera of Trichocomaceae and studied in detail the phylogeny of the genus itself. In order to study these relationships, partial RPB1, RPB2 (RNA polymerase II genes), Tsr1 (putative ribosome biogenesis protein) and Cct8 (putative chaperonin complex component TCP-1) gene sequences were obtained. The Trichocomaceae are divided in three separate families: Aspergillaceae, Thermoascaceae and Trichocomaceae. The Aspergillaceae are characterised by the formation flask-shaped or cylindrical phialides, asci produced inside cleistothecia or surrounded by Hülle cells and mainly ascospores with a furrow or slit, while the Trichocomaceae are defined by the formation of lanceolate phialides, asci borne within a tuft or layer of loose hyphae and ascospores lacking a slit. Thermoascus and Paecilomyces, both members of Thermoascaceae, also form ascospores lacking a furrow or slit, but are differentiated from Trichocomaceae by the production of asci from croziers and their thermotolerant or thermophilic nature. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Penicillium is polyphyletic. The genus is re-defined and a monophyletic genus for both anamorphs and teleomorphs is created (Penicillium sensu stricto). The genera Thysanophora, Eupenicillium, Chromocleista, Hemicarpenteles and Torulomyces belong in Penicillium s. str. and new combinations for the species belonging to these genera are proposed. Analysis of Penicillium below genus rank revealed the presence of 25 clades. A new classification system including both anamorph and teleomorph species is proposed and these 25 clades are treated here as sections. An overview of species belonging to each section is presented.",

		"abstract": "Fungi in the Rhizoscyphus ericae aggregate have been recovered from the roots of co-occurring ericaceous shrubs and ectomycorrhizal trees. However, to date, there is no evidence that the same individual genotypes colonize both hosts, and no information on the extent of the mycelial networks that might form. Using spatially explicit core sampling, we isolated fungi from neighbouring Pinus sylvestris (ectomycorrhizal) and Vaccinium vitis-idaea (ericoid mycorrhizal) roots and applied intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) typing to assess the occurrence and extent of shared genets. Most isolates were identified as Meliniomyces variabilis, and isolates with identical ISSR profiles were obtained from neighbouring ericoid and ectomycorrhizal roots on a number of occasions. However, genet sizes were small (< 13 cm), and several genets were found in a single soil core. Genetic relatedness was independent of spatial separation at the scales investigated (< 43 m) and M. variabilis populations from sites 20 km apart were genetically indistinguishable. We conclude that individual genets of M. variabilis can simultaneously colonize Scots pine and Vaccinium roots, but there is no evidence for the formation of large mycelial networks. Our data also suggest significant genotypic overlap between widely separated populations of this ubiquitous root-associated fungus. © The Authors (2010)",

		"abstract": "Live trees influence the nutrient status of the soil by the interception of substances from the atmosphere, the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and the deposition of litter. In an unmanaged old-growth spruce mountain forest on acidic soil, we analyzed how the death and decay of spruce trees affects the acidity and element concentrations of the soil, tree bark (or outermost stemwood) and stemflow. Key study objective was to examine whether the element release from decaying deadwood significantly increases the available soil nutrient stocks in the senescence phase of coniferous forests. Bark and stemflow chemistry responded to the death and decay of the trees with lowered acidity and reduced nutrient concentrations, which was attributed to the gradual loss of the intercepting canopy surface. Bark and stemflow concentrations of base cations (K, Ca, Mg) showed a transient peak in the course of wood decay. Published evidence suggests that the variability in bark and stemflow chemistry detected across the sequence of wood decay stages was sufficient to shape the epiphytic lichen and bryophyte communities. The death and decay of spruce trees also resulted in elevated base saturation near standing deadwood. Downed deadwood had a negligible effect on soil chemistry, among others due to slow decomposition in the studied cold mountain forest. Soil acidity was not significantly affected by deadwood. The release of base cations from standing deadwood to the soil suggests that sparing part of the trees in managed forests from logging could counteract nutrient depletion through timber harvesting.",

A range of novel methods, most of which are based on rRNA and rDNA analyses, have uncovered part of the soil microbial diversity. The next step in the era of microbial ecology is to extract genomic, evolutionary and functional information from bacterial artificial chromosome libraries of the soil community genomes (the metagenome). Sophisticated analyses that apply molecular phylogenetics, DNA microarrays, functional genomics and in situ activity measurements will provide huge amounts of new data, potentially increasing our understanding of the structure and function of soil microbial ecosystems, and the interactions that occur within them.

However, these practices may also alter soil microbial community structure and rates of decomposition and respiration. The effects of mounding, drainage and fertilization were investigated at a mounded hybrid spruce site and a drained coastal western redcedar – western hemlock site in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada. CO2 efflux was measured at four dates over a one-year period using static closed chambers. Total bacterial and fungal ribosomal marker abundance and structure were assessed using quantitative PCR and terminal-restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), respectively. Mounding reduced soil water content of planting sites, but also removed much of the forest floor layer from the rooting zone and led to a significant decrease in CO2 efflux rates, as well as bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity. Drainage increased CO2 fluxes and led to significant differences in T-RFLP profiles in drained and undrained samples. Fertilization had variable effects on the microbial community and CO2 fluxes at the two sites. Site preparation and fertilization can improve regeneration of wet forests that would otherwise be subject to paludification, but can lead to shifts in carbon fluxes and microbial community structure. Major disturbances to soil structure and composition (e.g., following mounding) can alter the microbial community structure in a way that suppresses microbial diversity and function for up to one year following treatment.",

		"abstract": "Soil is one of the most important assets of the planet Earth, responsible for maintaining the biodiversity and managing the ecosystem services for both managed and natural ecosystems. It encompasses large proportion of microscopic biodiversity, including prokaryotes and the microscopic eukaryotes. Soil microbiome is critical in managing the soil functions, but their activities have diminutive recognition in few systems like desert land and forest ecosystems. Soil microbiome is highly dependent on abiotic and biotic factors like pH, carbon content, soil structure, texture, and vegetation, but it can notably vary with ecosystems and the respective inhabitants. Thus, unboxing this black box is essential to comprehend the basic components adding to the soil systems and supported ecosystem services. Recent advancements in the field of molecular microbial ecology have delivered commanding tools to examine this genetic trove of soil biodiversity. Objective of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of the work on the soil microbiome, especially since the advent of the NGS techniques. The review also focuses on advances in our understanding of soil communities, their interactions, and functional capabilities along with understanding their role in maneuvering the biogeochemical cycle while underlining and tapping the unprecedented metagenomics data to infer the ecological attributes of yet undiscovered soil microbiome. This review focuses key research directions that could shape the future of basic and applied research into the soil microbiome. This review has led us to understand that it is difficult to generalize that soil microbiome plays a substantiated role in shaping the soil networks and it is indeed a vital resource for sustaining the ecosystem functioning. Exploring soil microbiome will help in unlocking their roles in various soil network. It could be resourceful in exploring and forecasting its impacts on soil systems and for dealing with alleviating problems like rapid climate change.",

		"abstract": "Background Hierarchical partitioning (HP) is an analytical method of multiple regression that identifies the most likely causal factors while alleviating multicollinearity problems. Its use is increasing in ecology and conservation by its usefulness for complementing multiple regression analysis. A public-domain software “hier.part package” has been developed for running HP in R software. Its authors highlight a “minor rounding error” for hierarchies constructed from >9 variables, however potential bias by using this module has not yet been examined. Knowing this bias is pivotal because, for example, the ranking obtained in HP is being used as a criterion for establishing priorities of conservation. Methodology/Principal Findings Using numerical simulations and two real examples, we assessed the robustness of this HP module in relation to the order the variables have in the analysis. Results indicated a considerable effect of the variable order on the amount of independent variance explained by predictors for models with >9 explanatory variables. For these models the nominal ranking of importance of the predictors changed with variable order, i.e. predictors declared important by its contribution in explaining the response variable frequently changed to be either most or less important with other variable orders. The probability of changing position of a variable was best explained by the difference in independent explanatory power between that variable and the previous one in the nominal ranking of importance. The lesser is this difference, the more likely is the change of position. Conclusions/Significance HP should be applied with caution when more than 9 explanatory variables are used to know ranking of covariate importance. The explained variance is not a useful parameter to use in models with more than 9 independent variables. The inconsistency in the results obtained by HP should be considered in future studies as well as in those already published. Some recommendations to improve the analysis with this HP module are given.",

		"abstract": "Microbial community analysis via high-throughput sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes is an essential microbiology tool. We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine taxa. We evaluated marine samples and mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y (5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5'-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r(2)  = 0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r(2)  ∼ 0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (∼4-10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (∼2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA (> 1 μm size fraction), 18S sequences averaged ∼17% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential amplification. We show that beyond in silico predictions, testing with mock communities and field samples is important in primer selection.",

		"abstract": "Impacts of harvest intensity and soil disturbance on site productivity are likely to vary with stand development stage and interactive processes related to ecosystem function. On upland boreal sites, stand productivity may initially be constrained by microclimatic conditions. However, increasing nutrient demands and overstory light interception associated with canopy development may place progressively greater emphasis on nutrient availability, profile water storage capacity and asymmetric competition. We illustrate these effects using 20-yr post-harvest data from fourteen jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) installations in northern Ontario. Initial growth and ten-year survival were as great or greater without forest floors (NFF), but by year 15 dominant height increments were usually greater with intact forest floors (FF). Growing season frost occurrence and high vapor pressure deficits occurred more frequently with FF than NFF treatments during the initial stand establishment phase. Similarly, mean growing season soil temperatures were 2-5˚C warmer with NFF during this phase, with stand Leaf Area Index (LAI) values < 0.5. During the following Accelerated Growth phase, treatment differences in microclimate dissipated as LAI increased. Foliar N concentrations and N:P ratios, and soil net N mineralization were usually greater from an early age with FF, and often declined as canopy closure approached. Likewise, modelled site-level constraints related to soil water availability increased with stand development, peaking at LAI values associated with the stem exclusion stage. Placing post-harvest response (i.e., impacts of harvest intensity) in the context of relationships among stand structural development, changes in microclimate, and resource supply and demand should provide greater insights into longer-term effects of establishment practices.",

		"abstract": "Polyvinyl-alcohol-degrading bacteria were isolated from the fruit of a grape in Yokosuka, Japan. The isolated strain, Zumi 37(T), was a Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, motile, non-spore-forming and strictly aerobic chemo-organotroph, showing optimal growth at pH 7.5, 30 °C and 0.1% (w/v) NaCl. The major respiratory quinone was Q-8. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), C(16 : 0) and C(16 : 1)ω7c. The major polyamines were homospermidine and putrescine. The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 64.2 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed that strain Zumi 37(T) belongs to the family Sinobacteraceae within the class Gammaproteobacteria. Steroidobacter denitrificans DSM 18526(T) was the most closely related species with a validly published name, with 98.0% similarity based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison (and showed less than 87.5% sequence similarity to members of the genera Alkanibacter, Fontimonas, Hydrocarboniphaga, Nevskia and Solimonas with known 16S rRNA gene sequences). Phenotypes for growth under aerobic conditions and on complex media and major fatty acid composition, differed greatly from those of with comparatively high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic evidence, it is proposed that strain Zumi 37(T) represents a novel species in a new genus for which the name Povalibacter uvarum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is Zumi 37(T) ( = JCM 18749(T) = DSM 26723(T)).",

		"abstract": "Direct gradient analyses in spatial genetics provide unique opportunities to describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a systemic issue in multivariate regression analyses and is likely to cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few inherent limitations, especially in the case of resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses.",

		"abstract": "Emulation silviculture is the use of silvicultural techniques that try to imitate natural disturbances such as wildfire. Emulation silviculture is becoming increasingly popular in Canada because it may help circumvent the political and environmental difficulties associated with intensive forest harvesting practices. In this review we summarize empirical evidence that illustrates disparities between forest harvesting and wildfire. As a rule, harvesting and wildfire affect biodiversity in different ways, which vary a great deal among ecosystem types, harvesting practices, and scale of disturbance. The scales of disturbance are different in that patch sizes created by logging are a small subset of the range of those of wildfire. In particular, typical forestry does not result in the large numbers of small disturbances and the small number of extremely large disturbances created by wildfires. Moreover, the frequency of timber harvesting is generally different from typical fire return intervals. The latter varies widely, with stand-replacing fires occurring in the range of 20 to 500 years in Canada. In contrast, harvest frequencies are dictated primarily by the rotational age at merchantable size, which typically ranges from 40 to 100 years. Forest harvesting does not maintain the natural stand-age distributions associated with wildfire in many regions, especially in the oldest age classes. The occurrence of fire on the landscape is largely a function of stand age and flammability, slope, aspect, valley orientation, and the location of a timely ignition event. These factors result in a complex mosaic of stand types and ages on the landscape. Timber harvesting does not generally emulate these ecological influences. The shape of cut blocks does not follow the general ellipse pattern of wind driven fires, nor do harvested stands have the ragged edges and unburned patches typically found in stand-replacing fires. Wildfire also leaves large numbers of snags and abundant coarse woody debris, while some types of harvesting typically leave few standing trees and not much large debris. Successional pathways following logging and fire often differ. Harvesting tends to favor angiosperm trees and results in less dominance by conifers. Also, understory species richness and cover do not always recover to the pre-harvest condition during the rotation periods used in typical logging, especially in eastern Canada and in old-growth forests. As well, animal species that depend on conifers or old-growth forests are affected negatively by forest harvesting in ways that may not occur after wildfire. The road networks developed for timber extraction cause erosion, reduce the areas available for reforestation, fragment the landscape for some species and ecological functions, and allow easier access by humans, whereas there is no such equivalency in a fire-disturbed forest.

		"abstract": "A major open question in microbial community ecology is whether we can predict how the components of a diet collectively determine the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether communities assembled in pairs of nutrients can be predicted from those assembled in every single nutrient alone. We find that although the null, naturally additive model generally predicts well the family-level community composition, there exist systematic deviations from the additive predictions that reflect generic patterns of nutrient dominance at the family level. Pairs of more-similar nutrients (e.g. two sugars) are on average more additive than pairs of more dissimilar nutrients (one sugar–one organic acid). Furthermore, sugar–acid communities are generally more similar to the sugar than the acid community, which may be explained by family-level asymmetries in nutrient benefits. Overall, our results suggest that regularities in how nutrients interact may help predict community responses to dietary changes.",

		"abstract": ": A potent ecdysone agonist, tebufenozide, has recently been developed as a molt-inducing insecticide to control defoliating lepidopterans. As part of continuing research efforts to assess the effectiveness and environmental safety of this material for insect pest management in Canadian forests, tebufenozide (RH-5992-2F) was applied to large lake enclosures and the effects on zooplankton communities were evaluated. There were significant treatment effects at all test concentrations (0.07-0.66 mg L(-1) tebufenozide). Concentration-dependent reductions in the abundance of cladocerans indicated that there were direct toxic effects of tebufenozide on this group of macrozooplankton. There were no indications of direct toxic effects on copepods. Significant increases in abundance of rotifers in treated enclosures at the three higher test concentrations were coincident with reductions in cladocerans and indicated secondary effects of the insecticide on the abundance of microzooplankton. There were no significant differences among treated and control enclosures in chlorophyll a concentrations, indicating that tebufenozide did not have direct effects on phytoplankton biomass, nor did the alterations in the zooplankton communities of treated enclosures have measurable secondary effects on phytoplankton biomass. Daytime dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly higher in treated enclosures than in controls, indicating that the perturbation to biotic communities of some treated enclosures was sufficient to induce measurable changes in system-level functional attributes. Recovery of zooplankton communities in the enclosures occurred within 1-2 months at 0.07 and 0.13 mg l(-1) and by the following summer (12-13 months) at 0.33 and 0.66 mg l(-1).",

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.",

		"abstract": "Forest biomass harvesting guidelines help ensure the ecological sustainability of forest residue harvesting for bioenergy and bioproducts, and hence contribute to social license for a growing bioeconomy. Guidelines, typically voluntary, provide a means to achieve outcomes often required by legislation, and must address needs related to local or regional context, jurisdictional compatibility with regulations, issues of temporal and spatial scale, and incorporation of appropriate scientific information. Given this complexity, comprehensive reviews of existing guidelines can aid in development of new guidelines or revision of existing ones. We reviewed 32 guidelines covering 43 jurisdictions in the USA, Canada, Europe and East Asia to expand upon information evaluated and recommendations provided in previous guideline reviews, and compiled a searchable spreadsheet of direct quotations from documents as a foundation for our review. Guidelines were considered in the context of sustainable forest management (SFM), focusing on guideline scope and objectives, environmental sustainability concerns (soils, site productivity, biodiversity, water and carbon) and social concerns (visual aesthetics, recreation, and preservation of cultural, historical and archaeological sites). We discuss the role of guidelines within the context of other governance mechanisms such as SFM policies, trade regulations and non-state market-driven (NSMD) standards, including certification systems. The review provides a comprehensive resource for those developing guidelines, or defining sustainability standards for market access or compliance with public regulations, and/or concerned about the sustainability of forest biomass harvesting. We recommend that those developing or updating guidelines consider (i) the importance of well-defined and understood terminology, consistent where possible with guidelines in other jurisdictions or regions; (ii) guidance based on locally relevant research, and periodically updated to incorporate current knowledge and operational experience; (iii) use of indicators of sensitive soils, sites, and stands which are relevant to ecological processes and can be applied operationally; and (iv) incorporation of climate impacts, long-term soil carbon storage, and general carbon balance considerations when defining sustainable forest biomass availability. Successful implementation of guidelines depends both on the relevance of the information and on the process used to develop and communicate it; hence, appropriate stakeholders should be involved early in guideline development.",

		"abstract": "Forest soil ecosystems can be negatively affected by intensive biomass harvesting due to losses of organic inputs and soil compaction, ultimately leading to reduced forest productivity. In this research, we revisited a site from the North American Long-Term Soil Productivity study located on a sandy Spodosol within the Huron National Forest in Michigan, USA, to measure the effects of aboveground organic matter removal of different intensities (three levels: bole only; whole tree harvest; or whole tree harvest and forest floor removal) and soil compaction (2 levels: no or moderate compaction) nearly 20 years following the initial treatments. The effects of harvesting on the soil microbial community in surface and subsurface soils and on soil nutrient availability in surface soils were evaluated. Additionally, patterns of carbon and nitrogen distribution among soil organic matter pools in surface and subsurface soils were compared using a physical fractionation approach to isolate a free – light fraction of particulate organic matter external to aggregates, an occluded – light fraction, which represents particulate organic matter released from the disruption of soil aggregates, and a heavy or mineral-associated fraction. Whole-tree harvests had significantly different microbial community compositions than bole-only harvests (P = 0.02), a result driven by significantly lower abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizae and greater gram positive bacterial abundance in the whole-tree harvest relative to bole-only harvest conditions. Few differences in soil nutrient availability were apparent 20 years after organic matter manipulations, with the exception of reduced calcium availability where organic matter was removed. Soil compaction resulted in greater microbial biomass (0.19 versus 0.14 μmol g−1 soil), which may have also led to a reduced C:N ratio in the heaviest and oldest soil component and increased P availability as well. Nitrogen concentrations and stocks were greatest at the surface (0–10 cm depth) for the free and light soil fractions in bole-only removal treatments, in contrast to whole-tree harvest treatments where C and N concentrations and C stocks were greater in the subsurface soil (free - light fraction at 20–30 cm depth). The soil microbial community, soil fraction size, and soil C and N stocks differed between surface and subsurface soils, highlighting the soil forming processes at work in this Spodosol, and the importance of sampling multiple depths to address research questions. These results demonstrate the long-term effects of forest management on soil biological, physical, and chemical properties and are useful in evaluating sustainable biomass harvesting practices for comparable forests.",

Using meta-analysis, we synthesized results from over 75 manipulative experiments in order to test for patterns in the effects of elevated CO₂, warming, and altered precipitation on the abundance of soil biota related to taxonomy, body size, feeding habits, ecosystem type, local climate, treatment magnitude and duration, and greenhouse CO₂ enrichment. We found that the positive effect size of elevated CO₂ on the abundance of soil biota diminished with time, whereas the negative effect size of warming and positive effect size of precipitation intensified with time. Trophic group, body size, and experimental approaches best explained the responses of soil biota to elevated CO₂, whereas local climate and ecosystem type best explained responses to warming and altered precipitation. The abundance of microflora and microfauna, and particularly detritivores, increased with elevated CO₂, indicative of microbial limitation under ambient CO₂. However, the effects of CO₂ were smaller in field studies than in greenhouse studies and were not significant for higher trophic levels. Effects of warming did not depend on taxon or body size, but reduced abundances were more likely to occur at the colder and drier sites. Precipitation limited all taxa and trophic groups, particularly in forest ecosystems. Our meta-analysis suggests that the responses of soil biota to global change are predictable and unique for each global change factor.",

Our understanding of the role that soil organisms play in ecosystems is still developing, but the increased investigation into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in soils over the past couple of decades has provided insights that have greatly enhanced our ability to sustainably manage soil biodiversity. In this review, we synthesize emerging knowledge of soil biodiversity as a natural resource that supports the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and their delivery of ecosystem services. We explore how environmental changes alter soil biodiversity and how this in turn can affect ecosystem processes as well as resistance and resilience to environmental changes. We then discuss ways to include soil biodiversity in management strategies for sustainable production and biodiversity conservation. We conclude by highlighting key research challenges to further improve our knowledge of soil biodiversity and its management.",

Because phenotypic identification is expert-limited, a shift towards DNA metabarcoding could improve scalability and democratize the use of forest floor arthropods for biomonitoring applications. The objective of this study was to establish the level of field sampling and DNA extraction replication needed for arthropod biodiversity assessments from soil. Processing 15 individually collected soil samples recovered significantly higher median richness (488–614 sequence variants) than pooling the same number of samples (165–191 sequence variants) prior to DNA extraction, and we found no significant richness differences when using 1 or 3 pooled DNA extractions. Beta diversity was robust to changes in methodological regimes. Though our ability to identify taxa to species rank was limited, we were able to use arthropod COI metabarcodes from forest soil to assess richness, distinguish among sites, and recover site indicators based on unnamed exact sequence variants. Our results highlight the need to continue DNA barcoding local taxa during COI metabarcoding studies to help build reference databases. All together, these sampling considerations support the use of soil arthropod COI metabarcoding as a scalable method for biomonitoring.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this review is to present the most common and emerging DNA-based methods used to generate data for biodiversity and biomonitoring studies. As environmental assessment and monitoring programmes may require biodiversity information at multiple levels, we pay particular attention to the DNA metabarcoding method and discuss a number of bioinformatic tools and considerations for producing DNA-based indicators using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), taxa at a variety of ranks and community composition. By developing the capacity to harness the advantages provided by the newest technologies, investigators can “scale up” by increasing the number of samples and replicates processed, the frequency of sampling over time and space, and even the depth of sampling such as by sequencing more reads per sample or more markers per sample. The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact. As genomic approaches are continually evolving, we provide this guide to methods used in biodiversity genomics.",

		"abstract": "In the most recent scientific reports based on the DNA or RNA-analyses a widespread presence of the filamentous fungi, Mortierella in various environments has been shown. Some strains of this genus belong to the plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) and are found in the bulk soil, rhizosphere and plants tissues. These microorganisms are also often found in the extremely hostile environments, responsible for improving access to the bioavailable forms of P and Fe in the soils, the synthesis of phytohormones and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and last but not least the protection of agricultural plants from pathogens. Furthermore, earlier reports classified Mortierella spp. as the saprotrophic microorganisms isolated from the forest litter, and nowadays their status as a very valuable decomposers in the agricultural soils was confirmed. The key features like the ability to survive under very unfavorable environmental conditions and the utilization of carbon sources contained in polymers like cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin make these fungi efficient as the agricultural inoculants. The growing interest in the application of Mortierella spp. is mainly due to the potential use of this genus in the increase of the nutrient uptake efficiency, positive effect in crop protection against adverse conditions, and reduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides applied. Moreover, activities of Mortierella species selected from the wild or cultivated plants influence the soil microbiota and support the performance of the beneficial microorganisms enhancing significantly crop yield.",

		"abstract": "Extracellular DNA from dead microorganisms can persist in soil for weeks to years1–3. Although it is implicitly assumed that the microbial DNA recovered from soil predominantly represents intact cells, it is unclear how extracellular DNA affects molecular analyses of microbial diversity. We examined a wide range of soils using viability PCR based on the photoreactive DNA-intercalating dye propidium monoazide4. We found that, on average, 40% of both prokaryotic and fungal DNA was extracellular or from cells that were no longer intact. Extracellular DNA inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal richness by up to 55% and caused significant misestimation of taxon relative abundances, including the relative abundances of taxa integral to key ecosystem processes. Extracellular DNA was not found in measurable amounts in all soils; it was more likely to be present in soils with low exchangeable base cation concentrations, and the effect of its removal on microbial community structure was more profound in high-pH soils. Together, these findings imply that this ‘relic DNA’ remaining in soil after cell death can obscure treatment effects, spatiotemporal patterns and relationships between microbial taxa and environmental conditions.",

		"abstract": "Ecologists have long acknowledged the importance of seed banks; yet, despite the fact that many plants rely on mycorrhizal fungi for survival and growth, the structure of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal spore banks remains poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to assess the geographic structure in pine-associated ECM fungal spore banks across the North American continent. Soils were collected from 19 plots in forests across North America. Fresh soils were pyrosequenced for fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons. Adjacent soil cores were dried and bioassayed with pine seedlings, and colonized roots were pyrosequenced to detect resistant propagules of ECM fungi. The results showed that ECM spore banks correlated strongly with biogeographic location, but not with the identity of congeneric plant hosts. Minimal community overlap was found between resident ECM fungi vs those in spore banks, and spore bank assemblages were relatively simple and dominated by Rhizopogon, Wilcoxina, Cenococcum, Thelephora, Tuber, Laccaria and Suillus. Similar to plant seed banks, ECM fungal spore banks are, in general, depauperate, and represent a small and rare subset of the mature forest soil fungal community. Yet, they may be extremely important in fungal colonization after large-scale disturbances such as clear cuts and forest fires.",

		"abstract": "Cellulosic biofuel from forest thinning operations is a potential renewable energy source in regions with overstocked forests such as those in western United States. However, it is possible that biomass removal can deplete nutrients from soil, which can alter soil respiration (Rs) and exoenzyme properties, and potentially impact tree growth. This study evaluates the impact of biomass removal on Rs and exoenzyme properties and the capacity of soil amendments to counteract any potential effects. At two study locations, we created four post-thinning biomass retention levels: full biomass removal (0×), full biomass retention (1×), double biomass retention (2×), and a no-thin treatment. Four soil amendment treatments were applied to each biomass retention level: N fertilizer (F), biochar (B), fertilizer plus biochar (FB), and an untreated control (C). We evaluated treatment effects on Rs and activity of four exoenzymes to represent C-cycling, N-release, and P-release processes. Biomass retention levels had no effect on Rs (p = .42) or exoenzyme activities (p > .29). Variation in exoenzyme activity was explained by location, season, soil organic matter, soil moisture content, and temperature. Variation in Rs was explained by the same variables, in addition to C-cycling exoenzyme activity and soil pH. Soil amendments had no effect on exoenzyme activities (p > .49), and no main effect on Rs (p = .48), though amendments influenced Rs differently at each location (p = .02). Short-term findings suggest small-diameter biomass removal for cellulosic biofuel production will not impact Rs and exoenzyme properties, and paired with our tree growth study, provide evidence that biofuel systems are a feasible renewable energy source in the western North America.",

The advances are short formation time, healthy plants and reliable colonization. A high glucose demand and a good gas exchange with additional carbon dioxide are important factors in the mycorrhiza formation. Mycorrhiza was observed after 8 weeks, but strong colonization occurred after 10-12 weeks, when mycorrhiza was established to the depth of 5 cm. A C. cibarius strain connected to Picea abies in nature successfully colonized Pinus sylvestris in vitro, but not Betula pendula. Mycorrhizal plants have been successfully transferred to unsterile environments in greenhouses. The mycorrhizae continued to colonize new roots and the unsterile peat soil for 10 months. However, C. cibarius mycorrhiza is highly sensitive to flooding. With PCR and RFLP, fruit bodies, isolated mycelia and artificially formed mycorrhizae have been compared to prove that C. cibarius was used. Climatic changes did not induce primordia formation, but factors behind fruit body formation are discussed.",

		"abstract": "The effects of forest harvesting on headwaters are quite well understood, yet our understanding of whether impacts accumulate or dissipate downstream is limited. To address this, we investigated whether several biotic indicators changed from smaller to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins that had intensive, extensive or minimal forest management in New Brunswick (Canada). Biofilm biomass and grazer abundance significantly increased from upstream to downstream, whereas organic matter decomposition and the autotrophic index of biofilms decreased. However, some spatial trends differed among basins and indicated either cumulative (macroinvertebrate abundance, predator density, sculpin GSI) or dissipative (autotrophic index, cotton decomposition) effects downstream, potentially explained by sediment and nutrient dynamics related to harvesting. No such among-basin differences were observed for leaf decomposition, biofilm biomass, macroinvertebrate richness or sculpin condition. Additionally, results suggest that some of the same biological impacts of forestry observed in small headwaters also occurred in larger systems. Although the intensive and extensive basins had lower macroinvertebrate diversity, there were no other signs of biological impairment, suggesting that, overall, current best management practices protect biological integrity downstream despite abiotic effects.",

		"abstract": "Though effects of forest harvesting on small streams are well documented, little is known about the cumulative effects in downstream systems. The hierarchical nature and longitudinal connectivity of river networks make them fundamentally cumulative, but lateral and vertical connectivity and instream processes can dissipate the downstream transport of water and materials. To elucidate such effects, we investigated how a suite of abiotic indicators changed from small streams to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins ranging in forest management intensity (intensive, extensive, minimal) in New Brunswick (Canada) in the summer and fall of 2017 and 2018. Inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and water temperatures significantly increased longitudinally, whereas nutrients and the fluorescence index of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; indication of terrestrial source) decreased. However, some longitudinal trends differed across basins and indicated downstream cumulative (inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and to a lesser extent DOC concentration and humification) as well as dissipative (temperatures, nutrients, organic sediments) effects of forest management. Overall, we found that the effects previously reported for small streams with managed forests also occur at downstream sites and suggest investigating whether different management practices can be used within the extensive basin to reduce these cumulative effects.",

		"abstract": "Eleven species of common fungi from compost were analysed for their content of ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) after growth on agar media. Mean content of ergosterol was 3.1 mg g−1dw of fungal mycelium (range 1–24 mg g−1dw). Total amount of PLFAs varied between 2.6 and 43.5 μmolg−1dw of fungi (mean 14.9μmolg−1dw). The most common PLFAs were 16:0, 18:2ω6,9 and 18:1ω9, comprising between 79 and 97mol% of the total amount of PLFAs. The PLFA 18:2ω6,9, suggested as a marker molecule for fungi, comprised between 36 and 61mol% of the total PLFAs in the Ascomycetes, between 45 and 57mol% in the Basidiomycetes and 12–22mol% in the Zygomycetes. There was a good correlation between the content of the two fungal marker molecules, ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ω6,9, with a mean content of 1 mg ergosterol being equivalent to 2.1μmol of 18:2ω6,9. Based on results from the fungal isolates, conversion factors were calculated (5.4 mg ergosterolg−1 biomass C and 11.8μmol 18:2ω6,9 g−1 biomass C) and applied to compost samples in which both the ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ω6,9 content had been measured. This resulted in similar estimates of fungal biomass C using the two marker molecules, but was three to five times higher than total microbial biomass C calculated using ATP content in the compost. This could partly be explained by the fact that both of the markers used for fungal biomass are cell membrane constituents. Thus, the ergosterol and the PLFA content were related to the hyphal diameter of the fungi, where fungi with thinner hyphae had higher ergosterol concentrations than fungi with thicker hyphae. This could also partly explain the large interspecific variation in content of the two marker molecules.",

		"abstract": "The use of total lipid phosphate as a measure of biomass was evaluated in soils with different organic matter content. Lipids were extracted with a one-phase mixture of chloroform, methanol, and a buffer, and digested with either persulfate or perchloric acid to liberate lipid-bound phosphate. This procedure was evaluated by varying the extraction buffer, the extraction and digestion times, the amount of soil extracted, and the amount of lipid material digested. An extraction period of 2 h was sufficient to yield maximum lipid phosphate. Neither sonication, vigorous mixing, nor longer extraction periods increased the amount of lipid phosphate extracted. However, the amount of lipid phosphate recovered was dependent on the choice of buffer. When organic soil was used, citrate buffer in the extraction mixture gave higher amounts of lipid phosphate than acetate buffer, Tris, H2O or phosphate buffer. In a sandy loam with low organic matter content, citrate or phosphate buffers performed equally well. When 13 soils of different organic matter content were examined, the two digestion methods showed a good linear correlation (r2 = 0.991). Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and ATP contents of the different soils correlated well with the total lipid phosphate. Based on these measurements, a conversion factor of 500 μmol lipid phosphate·g−1 biomass-C (perchloric acid digestion) was calculated.",

		"abstract": "Deciphering microbiota functions is crucial to predict ecosystem sustainability in response to global change. High-throughput sequencing at the individual or community level has revolutionized our understanding of microbial ecology, leading to the big data era and improving our ability to link microbial diversity with microbial functions. Recent advances in bioinformatics have been key for developing functional prediction tools based on DNA metabarcoding data and using taxonomic gene information. This cheaper approach in every aspect serves as an alternative to shotgun sequencing. Although these tools are increasingly used by ecologists, an objective evaluation of their modularity, portability, and robustness is lacking. Here, we reviewed 100 scientific papers on functional inference and ecological trait assignment to rank the advantages, specificities, and drawbacks of these tools, using a scientific benchmarking. To date, inference tools have been mainly devoted to bacterial functions, and ecological trait assignment tools, to fungal functions. A major limitation is the lack of reference genomes—compared with the human microbiota—especially for complex ecosystems such as soils. Finally, we explore applied research prospects. These tools are promising and already provide relevant information on ecosystem functioning, but standardized indicators and corresponding repositories are still lacking that would enable them to be used for operational diagnosis.",

		"abstract": "Impacts of harvest intensity and soil disturbance on site productivity are likely to vary with stand development stage and interactive processes related to ecosystem function. On upland boreal sites, stand productivity may initially be constrained by microclimatic conditions. However, increasing nutrient demands and overstory light interception associated with canopy development may place progressively greater emphasis on nutrient availability, profile water storage capacity and asymmetric competition. We illustrate these effects using 20-yr post-harvest data from fourteen jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) installations in northern Ontario. Initial growth and ten-year survival were as great or greater without forest floors (NFF), but by year 15 dominant height increments were usually greater with intact forest floors (FF). Growing season frost occurrence and high vapor pressure deficits occurred more frequently with FF than NFF treatments during the initial stand establishment phase. Similarly, mean growing season soil temperatures were 2-5˚C warmer with NFF during this phase, with stand Leaf Area Index (LAI) values < 0.5. During the following Accelerated Growth phase, treatment differences in microclimate dissipated as LAI increased. Foliar N concentrations and N:P ratios, and soil net N mineralization were usually greater from an early age with FF, and often declined as canopy closure approached. Likewise, modelled site-level constraints related to soil water availability increased with stand development, peaking at LAI values associated with the stem exclusion stage. Placing post-harvest response (i.e., impacts of harvest intensity) in the context of relationships among stand structural development, changes in microclimate, and resource supply and demand should provide greater insights into longer-term effects of establishment practices.",

		"abstract": "Effects of soil scarification on long-term site productivity up to 70 years, and soil content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and macro nutrients, were studied in five site preparation experiments, established between 1922 and 1965 on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) heathland, on poor sandy sediments. The soil was inverted by spade, hoed, harrowed or ploughed. All scarification methods disturbed close to 100% of the soil surface, the most radical treatments to a depth of approximately 20 cm. Some of the experiments had an inadequate original design. However, by comparing the experiments some general characteristics were found. Site productivity measured as top height was higher on scarified plots than on control plots (P < 0.05), indicating that long-term site productivity was improved by scarification. Total C and N contents in soil were 6–41% and 16–30%, respectively, lower on scarified plots compared with control plots. On scarified plots, all mineral elements analysed showed equal or lower contents in the organic layer, including the field layer, ground layer, organic debris, and humus. Total contents of P, Mg and S in mineral soil samples from 60–100 cm depth were higher on scarified plots than in corresponding samples from control plots. On the two burned plots analysed, total C content in the soil was 2 and 31% lower than on controls, and total N content 10% higher and 63% lower.

		"abstract": "Environmental scientists often want to understand how upland features like forest cover affect receiving waterbodies (e.g., water quality). Upland areas are characterized by deriving various landscape attributes (e.g., % forest cover in catchment). However, this approach often assumes that the influence of upland features on receiving waterbodies is independent of their proximity to the waterbodies. This may not adequately describe important spatial patterns within the upland area, for example, if there was higher forest cover near the waterbody and lower forest cover farther away. The <em>R</em> statistical software package <strong><em>hydroweight</em></strong> helps to account for these patterns. <strong><em>hydroweight</em></strong> calculates landscape attributes based on distances to waterbodies — areas nearby have more influence than those farther away (i.e., inverse distance-weighting). We implement various scenarios described by Peterson <em>et al.</em> (2011) that include different types of straight-line and flow-path distances to waterbodies. We add to the literature of current implementations (<em>IDW-Plus</em> in <em>ArcGIS</em> software and <em>rdwplus</em> in <em>R</em> statistical software through <em>GRASS GIS</em> spatial software). However, <strong><em>hydroweight</em></strong> provides a set of simple and flexible functions to accommodate a wider set of scenarios and statistics (e.g., numerical and categorical raster and polygon inputs) in <em>R</em> using <em>WhiteboxTools</em> spatial software.

		"abstract": "Concentrations of 14 chemical elements (Al, B, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, N, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Zn) were measured in wood and bark of 126 sample trees representing different stages of decomposition in three major tree species of northwestern Russia: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and birch (Betula pendula Roth.). Changes in nutrient stores in decay classes were calculated with adjustments for the loss of density and volume by dead trees. Although the concentration of many nutrients increased relative to the estimated initial level, the total amount of most nutrients contained in dead trees declined with decay. For example, nitrogen stores declined from decay class 1 to 4 by 45% for birch, 39% for spruce, and by 60% for pine. The rate and pattern of these losses varied by nutrient and by species and were primarily related to the patterns of bark loss. Pine lost bark early in the process of decomposition and released many essential nutrients (i.e., N, P, Ca) at the early stages, while birch retained most of its bark throughout the decomposition process and lost nutrients more gradually. The temporal dynamics of N, Ca, and K loss in pine were examined using a chronosequence approach, and the results were used in stand-level modeling. The analysis of modeling results suggests that, in northwestern Russia, post-disturbance release of nutrients from woody detritus can potentially supply a large proportion of the net N, Ca, and K accumulation in live forest biomass.",

Where forestry has been practiced for several rotations large proportions of these species are considered threatened. Key attributes determining the suitability of down wood as habitat are decay stage, tree species, and size, specifically diameter. Both quantity and distribution of suitable down wood influence species’ presence and abundance. We present a simple framework describing use of down wood based on broad natural history features, derive predictions from the framework, then test these by review and summary of literature. Our focus is terrestrial vertebrates, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Species other than vertebrates are addressed to ensure that metrics derived for vertebrates also are appropriate for other organisms. Basic metrics are the same, but appropriate values span a larger range among nonvertebrates. Current evidence suggests that the “extinction debt” apparent for nonvertebrates is approaching for vertebrates. Predictions derived from underlying natural history hold when tested. From that basis we derive broad guidelines for forest planning and practice, and suggest how regional target values can be derived.",

Specifically, they provide the opportunity for the mechanisation of operations with proven improvements in both safety and cost-effectiveness. The additional development of cable-assist machines is potentially making a real step-change by expanding the operating range onto very steep slopes. This paper reviews these developments, the main engineering considerations of how cable-assist works, as well as the advances being made in terms of how such equipment is integrated into harvesting systems. The review also includes analyses of the operating guidelines that are either in place or being developed to help implement the systems.",

		"abstract": "A condensed history of forestry and forest management in New Brunswick’s Crown Forest during the 20th century is presented. It begins with a description of the advanced state of forest management in New Brunswick today. The description provides a sharp contrast to the subsequent detailing of forestry operations, and lack of forest management, that characterized the early decades of the 20th century. A gradual improvement followed, as professional forestry education and technology combined to elevate forestry practice. Next examined is forestry practice and its change across several distinct periods: the inter-wars period (1914–1938), WWII and aftermath (1939–1957), two decades of profound change (1958–1980), and the modern era (1981–2005). It is concluded that a few key events and individuals explain the gradual evolution of forestry in New Brunswick from controlled exploitation to sustainable management. Also suggested is that the Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Management at the University of New Brunswick must continue to attract the brightest and best to its forestry programmes, if New Brunswick is to maintain its leadership position in management of public forests.",

The 10.5 km2 watershed, located in the Eastern Temperate Mixed Forest on the Canadian Shield, has been the site of multidisciplinary studies on biogeochemical and ecological processes conducted across plot to catchment scales. The whole-ecosystem investigative approach was adopted from the outset and has allowed research to evolve from its original (and continuing) acidification focus to include investigations on the effects of climate change, forest harvesting and other forest ecosystem perturbations. The extensive scientific and support infrastructure allows for collection of a comprehensive data record essential for understanding long-term environmental trends. Data include atmospheric deposition, meteorology, stream hydrology and chemistry, soil, pore and ground water properties, understory and overstory vegetation, lake and outflow physical and chemical properties, and aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish community composition and abundance. These data have contributed to over 400 published research papers and graduate theses. The watershed has also figured prominently in many continent-wide comparisons advancing fundamental watershed theory. The knowledge gained at TLW has influenced pollutant emission and natural resource management policies provincially, nationally and internationally.",

		"abstract": "1 Timber harvesting exemplifies many aspects of experimental manipulation in applied ecology. Evaluation of the research approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address large-scale and human impacts on the environment. 2 We measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002. 3 The dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before–after, control–impact) or long-term data sets. 4 Statistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference). 5 Lack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue. 6 Synthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.",

		"abstract": "Buffer zones are an important component of forest-management strategies and are thought to reduce the impact of nutrients released after harvesting on water quality. Conceptually, steep slopes have shorter water residence times than shallow slopes, have a reduced capacity to moderate water quality, and therefore, require wider buffers. Carbon and N concentrations in riparian zone shallow soil water at 30 cm depth and lake water were measured on shallow and steep slopes at the Esker Lakes Research Area in northeastern Ontario to determine if nutrient concentrations were correlated to catchment terrain attributes. Field measured slope, slope class obtained from a triangular irregular network model, and upslope contributing area and topographic index calculated from a digital elevation model were calculated for each sampling location. Modeled terrain properties, including those currently used during forest-management planning, were not significantly correlated with soil water N and C concentrations, whereas only dissolved organic carbon levels were significantly greater on field measured steep slopes. Forest species composition and soil N levels were positively correlated with soil water N concentrations. These results from the undisturbed boreal ecosystem highlight the potential limitation of using only catchment slope as a tool for prescribing riparian buffers during harvesting when considering terrestrial nutrient export.",

		"abstract": "Long-term ecosystem studies are valuable for understanding integrated ecosystem response to global changes in atmospheric deposition and climate. We examined trends for a 35-year period (1982/83–2017/18) in concentrations of a range of solutes in precipitation and stream water from nine headwater catchments spanning elevation and surficial geology gradients at the Turkey Lakes watershed (TLW) in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Average annual water year (WY, October to September) concentrations in precipitation significantly declined over the period for sulphate (SO42À), nitrate (NO3À) and chloride (ClÀ), while calcium (Ca2+) and potassium (K+) concentrations increased, resulting in a significant pH increase from 4.2 to 5.7. Trends in stream chemistry through time are generally consistent with expectations associated with acidification recovery. Concentration of many stream water solutes (SO42À, ClÀ, calcium [Ca2+], magnesium [Mg2+] and NH4+ generally decreased, while others (silica [SiO2] and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) generally increased. Increases were also observed for alkalinity (six of nine catchments), acid neutralizing capacity ([ANC]; six of nine catchments) and pH (eight of nine catchments), while conductivity declined (six of nine catchments). Variability in trends among catchments are associated with differences in surficial geology and wetland cover. While absolute solute concentrations were generally lower at bedrock dominated high-elevation catchments compared to till dominated lower elevation catchments, the rate of change of concentration was often greater for high elevation catchments. This study confirms continued, but non-linear stream chemistry recovery from acidification, particularly at the less buffered high and moderate elevation sites. The heterogeneity of responses among catchments highlights our incomplete understanding of the relative importance of different mechanisms influencing stream chemistry and the consequences for downstream ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Previous studies of harvest impacts on stream chemistry from deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover have shown variable responses and recovery times. We hypothesized that this variability in response and recovery was due to the interactive effects of forest harvesting with regional and global environmental changes. We investigated harvest impacts on stream solute (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl–, SO42–, DOC, Si, NO3–, NH4+, total P) concentrations, pH and conductivity under clearcut, selection, and shelterwood harvesting using a before-after control-impact experimental approach. The experiment was conducted at the Turkey Lakes Watershed, a shade-tolerant sugar maple forest within the Boreal Shield Ecozone, over a 36 year period (15 year pre-harvest and 21 year post-harvest) that has experienced climate change and acidification recovery. Harvest impacts on stream chemistry were greatest in the clearcut, moderate in the selection cut, and least in the shelterwood cut. The largest impacts on stream solutes typically lasted one to six years following harvest, although some solutes were impacted during the entire 21 year post-harvest period. Different patterns in the response of stream solute concentrations included: initial deviations (increase or decrease) followed by a return to pre-harvest levels within two to four years (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, conductivity); initial increase followed by a decrease but still not recovered (K+); initial increase followed by a decrease to below pre-harvest levels (NO3–, Na+, Cl-); sustained elevated concentrations (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Si); and a noisy response (TP, SO42-, pH). The different patterns were consistent with expected changes in nutrient demand, sources, and transport (including changes in hillslope-stream hydrologic connectivity due to harvesting). Comparing harvest impacts to long-term climate change and acidification recovery showed that harvesting had antagonistic (mitigative) effects to environmental changes for some solutes (e.g., cations), while for others (e.g., DOC) harvesting had agonistic (synergistic) effects to environmental changes. These results emphasize the need for long-term monitoring to accurately interpret the consequences of forest harvesting practices on the resilience of forests experiencing environmental change.",

		"abstract": "Forests are vital to maintaining headwater stream integrity in forested biomes, which ensures the delivery of aquatic ecosystem services downstream. Forest harvesting, however, can alter land–water linkages and compromise stream integrity. Historically, the main effects of forestry on streams have been documented by studies that used relatively few (mainly abiotic) indicators and which focused on single harvesting events. However, forest management is expected to intensify in the future to meet increasing global wood demand and it is likely that our present understanding does not adequately capture the cumulative effects that streams will be subjected to under intensive forest management. To address this, we assessed the effects of varying forest management intensities on the integrity of 15 forest headwater streams in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We used a comprehensive approach to link multiple biotic and abiotic indicators of stream ecosystem integrity to reach- and catchment-level characteristics including forest management (e.g., cumulative harvesting over time, road density, forest condition). Most indicators detected the gradient in forest management intensity with abiotic indicators responding most strongly. Streams in catchments with highest management intensity (especially road density) tended to have higher fine inorganic sediment deposition and entrainment, water cations and carbon, dissolved organic matter humification, and water temperature. These abiotic differences were associated with higher biofilm biomass and shredder densities, but lower leaf decomposition. Evidence from our multi-indicator approach elucidated a potential effects pathway of higher inorganic sediment content in biofilms of organic matter potentially limiting or altering its use by microbial and benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities and resulting in reduced leaf decomposition rates. Overall, this study shows that current best management practices in an intensively managed watershed (and legacy effects from past management such as older road systems) do not fully protect against an increased delivery of terrestrial materials to streams with resulting habitat and biotic changes, but that they are mostly effective at preventing the impairment of BMI communities.",

A stage-based nutrient model indicated that harvest slash DWD was a net nitrogen and phosphorus sink for eight years following harvest and accumulated calcium during decay. Field observations of respiration and leaching supported model results with a respired C half-life of 8 years, while leached carbon export constituted 1.37% of the respired flux. DWD leachate carbon and nitrogen concentrations were 11× and 2× greater than from litter, respectively, and DWD leachate contributed disproportionately to soil C stocks.

		"abstract": "The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a downstream shift in the reliance of aquatic consumers from terrestrial to aquatic carbon sources, but this concept has rarely been assessed with longitudinal studies. Similarly, there are no studies addressing how forestry related disturbances to the structure of headwater food webs manifest (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether forest management alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1) autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to larger downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management (New Brunswick, Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food web length compare among three basins with different forest management intensity [intensive (harvest and replanting), extensive (harvest only), minimal] to detect potential cumulative/dissipative effects; and 3) forest management intensity and other catchment variables are influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as predicted, the reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector feeders) on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded stream was higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90% for some taxa). However, this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not observed within the extensively managed basin and was weaker within the intensively managed one, suggesting that forest management can alter food web dynamics along the river continuum. The dampening of downstream autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony observed in small streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream through the river continuum.",

		"abstract": "We outline a view of how road networks interact with stream networks at the landscape scale and, based on examples from recent and current research, illustrate how these interactions might affect biological and ecological processes in stream and riparian systems. At the landscape scale, certain definable geometric interactions involving peak flows (floods) and debris flows (rapid movements of soil, sediment, and large wood down steep stream channels) are influenced by the arrangement of the road network relative to the stream network. Although disturbance patches are created by peak-flow and debris-flow disturbances in mountain landscapes without roads, roads can alter the landscape distributions of the starting and stopping points of debris flows, and they can alter the balance between the intensity of flood peaks and the stream network's resistance to change. We examined this conceptual model of interactions between road networks and stream networks based on observations from a number of studies in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon (U.S.A.). Road networks appear to affect floods and debris flows and thus modify disturbance patch dynamics in stream and riparian networks in mountain landscapes. We speculate that these changes may influence the rates and patterns of survival and recovery of disturbed patches in stream networks, affecting ecosystem resilience, and we outline an approach for detecting such effects based on a patch dynamics perspective. A field sampling scheme for detecting the magnitude of various road effects on stream and riparian ecology could involve (1) landscape stratification of inherent stream network susceptibility to floods or debris flows, (2) overlay of road and stream networks and creation of areas with various densities of road-stream crossings, emphasizing midslope road-stream crossings, and (3) designations of expected high- and low-impact stream segments based on numbers of upstream road-stream crossings where sampling of selected biological variables would be conducted.",

		"abstract": "Although it is well known that the increasing size of the human population has a negative effect on freshwater biodiversity, the subject of whether or how the intersection of roads and streams (hereafter road crossings) influence the diversity of stream macro-invertebrates is under-researched. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we collected stream macro-invertebrates from road crossings (bridges and culverts) and compared their diversity with upstream and downstream sections. We found that road crossings had negative effects on the richness and abundance of native macro-invertebrates, as well as on the number of protected taxa. Our results showed also that alien individuals were more abundant at road crossings. These findings support the assumption that road crossings contribute to the spread of alien species. The assessment of environmental variables indicated that road crossings caused habitat modifications, and based on these it can be assumed that habitat modifications and associated phenomena (e.g. pollutants and storm events) were the major drivers of the observed patterns in biodiversity. Our results fill a knowledge gap and contribute to the deeper understanding of the effect of road crossings on freshwater biodiversity.",

		"abstract": "Streams represent active components of the carbon cycle as emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane to the atmosphere at a global scale. However, the mechanisms and governing factors of these emissions are still largely unknown, especially concerning the effect of land use. We compared dissolved and gaseous carbon dynamics in streams bordered by contrasting types of land use, specifically agriculture and forest. Carbon dioxide and methane partial pressures (pCO2 and pCH4, respectively) in the water body and carbon emissions via both gases were studied for 24h during four field expeditions. pCH4 did not differ between the two system types. pCO2 was constantly oversaturated in all streams and significantly higher in agricultural streams (annual mean 4282ppm) compared to forest streams (annual mean 2189ppm) during all seasons. However, emissions of CO2 were not significantly different between the stream types due to significantly higher gas transfer velocity in forest compared to agricultural streams. pCO2 was significantly positively correlated to the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus in the water. Furthermore, pCO2 was correlated to optical parameters of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, e.g., it increased with indicators of molecular size and an allochthonous fluorescent component identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). This study demonstrates that different forms of land use may trigger a cascade of effects on the carbon production and emission of streams linked to changes in DOM quality.",

		"abstract": "In aquatic ecosystems, light availability can significantly influence microbial turnover of terrestrial organic matter through associated metabolic interactions between phototrophic and heterotrophic communities. However, particularly in streams, microbial functions vary significantly with the structure of the streambed, that is the distribution and spatial arrangement of sediment grains in the streambed. It is therefore essential to elucidate how environmental factors synergistically define the microbial turnover of terrestrial organic matter in order to better understand the ecological role of photo-heterotrophic interactions in stream ecosystem processes. In outdoor experimental streams, we examined how the structure of streambeds modifies the influence of light availability on microbial turnover of leaf carbon (C). Furthermore, we investigated whether the studied relationships of microbial leaf C turnover to environmental conditions are affected by flow intermittency commonly occurring in streams. We applied leaves enriched with a 13C-stable isotope tracer and combined quantitative and isotope analyses. We thereby elucidated whether treatment induced changes in C turnover were associated with altered use of leaf C within the microbial food web. Moreover, isotope analyses were combined with measurements of microbial community composition to determine whether changes in community function were associated with a change in community composition. In this study, we present evidence, that environmental factors interactively determine how phototrophs and heterotrophs contribute to leaf C turnover. Light availability promoted the utilization of leaf C within the microbial food web, which was likely associated with a promoted availability of highly bioavailable metabolites of phototrophic origin. However, our results additionally confirm that the structure of the streambed modifies light-related changes in microbial C turnover. From our observations, we conclude that the streambed structure influences the strength of photo-heterotrophic interactions by defining the spatial availability of algal metabolites in the streambed and the composition of microbial communities. Collectively, our multifactorial approach provides valuable insights into environmental controls on the functioning of stream ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Perennial, temperate, low-order streams are predicted to become intermittent as a result of irregular droughts caused by global warming and increased water demand. We hypothesize that stream metabolism changes caused by irregular droughts are linked to the shading and bed sediment structure of temperate streams. We set up 16 outdoor experimental streams with low or high shade conditions and streambeds either with alternating sorted patches of gravel and sand or homogeneous gravel-sand mix sediment structures. We assessed community respiration (CR), net ecosystem production (NEP) and periphyton biomass and structure (diatoms, green algae, cyanobacteria) in the course of 6weeks colonization, 6weeks desiccation, and 2.5weeks after rewetting. The heterotroph to autotroph (H:A) and fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios in the microbial biofilm community were assessed at the end of the colonization and rewetting phases. Streams with different bed sediment structure were functionally similar; their metabolism under desiccation was controlled solely by light availability. During flow recession, all streams showed net heterotrophy. As desiccation progressed, NEP and CR decreased to zero. Desiccation altered the periphyton composition from predominantly diatoms to green algae and cyanobacteria, particularly in streams with low shade and mixed sediments. Rapid post-drought resilience of NEP was accompanied by high cyanobacteria and green algae growth in low shade, but poor total periphyton growth in high shade streams. Variable periphyton recovery was followed by increased H:A in relation to shading, and decreased F:B in relation to sediments structure. These shifts resulted in poor CR recovery compared to the colonization phase, suggesting a link between CR resilience and microbial composition changes. The links between drought effects, post-drought recovery, shading level, and streambed structure reveal the importance of low-order stream management under a changing climate and land use to mitigate the future impact of unpredictable infrequent droughts on stream metabolism in temperate ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Assessment of the condition of ecosystems is a critical prerequisite for alleviating effects of the multiple anthropogenic stresses imposed on them. For stream ecosystems, a multitude of approaches has been proposed for this purpose. However, they all rest on the assessment of structural attributes, even though it is generally recognized that adequate characterization of ecosystems requires information on both structure (pattern) and function (process). Therefore, we propose a complementary approach to stream assessment based on evaluating ecosystem-level processes. Leaf litter breakdown is a prime candidate to consider in this context. This is because of the pivotal role that allochthonous litter plays in streams, the demonstrated effects of anthropogenic perturbations on litter breakdown, and the relative ease of implementation. Leaf breakdown is governed by a variety of internal and external factors that complicate the partitioning of effects due to anthropogenic stress and natural variability (background noise), thus potentially limiting the sensitivity and robustness of litter breakdown assays. However, internal regulation factors can be controlled by standardizing assessment procedures, while variability due to external factors can be accounted for by stream classification and/or a comparative approach (e.g., downstream–upstream comparisons). Composite parameters such as ratios of breakdown rates in fine-mesh and coarse-mesh bags may further increase the power of litter breakdown assays. Analyses may also be extended to include both leaf-associated decomposer assemblages (i.e., structural measures) and processes (i.e., additional functional measures). Significant efforts are required for developing standard assessment schemes as refined as extant procedures based on structural stream attributes (e.g., structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages). These efforts are nevertheless worthwhile in view of the new dimension that is added to current assessment procedures when functional elements are incorporated.",

		"abstract": "Biofilms dominate microbial life in stream ecosystems. These matrix-enclosed and surface-attached microbial communities are ubiquitous, prolific and highly active at the interfaces of the streambed. The biofilm mode of life is advantageous in streams with a fast flow of water and continuous export of nutrients and organic matter.Biofilms in streams can be considered a 'microbial skin', regulating the processing and export of nutrients and organic matter from catchments and influencing the dispersal of microorganisms and their biodiversity dynamics at the scale of entire stream networks.Interactions between the growth of biofilms, streamwater flow and substratum chemistry produce emergent environmental complexity in the streambed.Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes often dominate the communities of stream biofilms. Flavobacteriia and Sphingobacteriia seem to be especially important members of these communities. Archaea are found within niche microenvironments established by the metabolic activity of other microorganisms.High biodiversity in stream biofilms is supported by continuous input of microorganisms from upstream catchments, environmental sorting induced by habitat heterogeneity (ranging from the scale of the biofilm to large stream networks) and episodic disturbance from streamwater flow.New interdisciplinary approaches are needed to link structure and function of biofilms to their environment and, ultimately, to ecosystem processes and biogeochemical fluxes in streams. This is crucial to understand and predict implications of global ecosystem change and climate change on the microbial ecology and functioning of stream ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Microbial community analysis via high-throughput sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes is an essential microbiology tool. We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine taxa. We evaluated marine samples and mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r2 = 0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r2 ∼ 0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (∼4–10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (∼2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA (> 1 μm size fraction), 18S sequences averaged ∼17% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential amplification. We show that beyond in silico predictions, testing with mock communities and field samples is important in primer selection.",

		"abstract": "Fungi support a wide range of ecosystem processes such as decomposition of organic matter and plant-soil relationships. Yet, our understanding of the factors driving the metaproteome of fungal communities is still scarce. Here, we conducted a field survey including data on fungal biomass (by phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA), community composition (by metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene from extracted DNA) and functional profile (by metaproteomics) to investigate soil fungi and their relation to edaphic and environmental variables across three ecosystems (forests, grasslands, and shrublands) distributed across the globe. We found that protein richness of soil fungi was significantly higher in forests than in shrublands. Among a wide suite of edaphic and environmental variables, we found that soil carbon content and plant cover shaped evenness and diversity of fungal soil proteins while protein richness correlated to mean annual temperature and pH. Functions shifted from metabolism in forests to information processing and storage in shrublands. The differences between the biomes highlight the utility of metaproteomics to investigate functional microbiomes in soil.\nSignificance\nUnderstanding the structure and the function of fungal communities and the driving factors is crucial to determine the contribution to ecosystem services of fungi and what effect future climate has. While there is considerable knowledge on the ecosystem processes provided by fungi such as decomposition of organic matter and plant-soil relationships, our understanding of the driving factors of the fungal metaproteome is scarce. Here we present the first estimates of fungal topsoil protein diversity in a wide range of soils across global biomes. We report taxonomic differences for genes delivered by amplicon sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and differences of the functional microbiome based on metaproteomics. Both methods gave a complementary view on the fungal topsoil communities, unveiling both taxonomic and functional changes with changing environments. Such a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of fungal topsoil communities has never been performed before, to our knowledge.",

		"abstract": "The removal of logging residues and stumps from clear-cuts has become a common forestry practice. Forest fuel harvesting decreases the initially low volume of dead wood in managed forests, but the biodiversity effects are poorly known. We studied the effects of forest fuel harvesting on decomposer fungi on clear-cut Norway spruce stands in central Finland. The number of occurrences and taxa of polypores, saprotrophic agarics and pleurotoid agarics were determined on 10 forest fuel harvested and 10 control clear-cuts 4–5 years after logging. In total, we recorded 148 fungal taxa. The total number of taxa, the number of polypore occurrences, and the number of polypore species within small area were lower at forest fuel harvested sites. The effect on the number of saprotrophic agaric taxa became obvious with increasing area. Most of the common polypore species had fewer occurrences on forest fuel harvested sites while the commonest agaric species increased due to forest fuel harvesting. Concerning different dead wood types, there were fewer fungal species and occurrences on stumps and fewer occurrences on logs on forest fuel harvested sites. Most of the effects of forest fuel harvesting were explained by the reduction in resource availability. We conclude that forest fuel harvesting, especially stump removal, has negative effects on decomposer fungi and that there is a risk that populations of certain species still thriving in managed forests will decline in the future.",

		"abstract": "Intensive organic matter removal (OMR) associated with timber harvest has the potential to impart long-term alterations to soil biota and associated properties and processes; however, there is a lack of data to say if this trend persists at depth. This study investigated how OMR influences long-term stability of soil fungi to a depth of 1 m using a replicated experimental pine forest in the Gulf Coastal Plain, USA. Treatments included unharvested control stands as well as low- and high-OMR stands. Intensive OMR led to significant differences in community structure and the abundance of functional guilds in surficial soil. Saprophytic taxa increased while ectomycorrhizal (ECM) taxa decreased with intensive-OMR, which correlated strongly with increased surface temperature and reduced soil nitrogen. Ericoid mycorrhizae (ERM) also increased in intensive-OMR stands, which may indicate that following disturbance, ERM could outcompete ECM for colonization of subsequent seedlings. Overall, no differences were observed below 30 cm, except for alpha diversity, which was a function of high inter-replicate variability. Our results illustrate a distinct long-term structural and functional response of soil fungi to intensive-OMR in the upper portions of the soil profile, which could lead to altered stand productivity and ecosystem services.",

Five species of mosses from a large urban ecosystem were identified for present study. In order to determine their biological potential, multifaceted studies were carried out, including: total phenolics content, antioxidant activity, antimicrobial and antifungal study, cytotoxicity evaluation, and scratch assay to assess pro-regenerative effect in the context of their possible use as the ingredients of biologically active cosmetics. Additionally, determination of individual phenolic compounds in selected extracts of the tested mosses was made. Research showed that Ceratodon purpureus and Dryptodon pulvinatus extracts had the greatest potential as antioxidants and antimicrobial activity. The cytotoxicity assessment indicated that the extracts from Dryptodon pulvinatus and Rhytidiadelphus squarossus exerted the strongest negative effect on mouse fibroblast line L929 viability at higher concentrations. While, the extract from Tortulla muralis best stimulated human foreskin fibroblast line HFF-1 proliferation and wound healing. The research on individual phenolic compounds content in the extracts tested indicated over 20 peaks on UPLC chromatograms. The conducted study has shown that mosses, especially so far unexplored species of open ecosystems, and e.g. epilytic habitats, may be a valuable source of biologically active substances and thus may constitute important medical and cosmetic possibilities.",

		"abstract": "Thermoflexus hugenholtzii JAD2T, the only cultured representative of the Chloroflexota order Thermoflexales, is abundant in Great Boiling Spring (GBS), NV, United States, and close relatives inhabit geothermal systems globally. However, no defined medium exists for T. hugenholtzii JAD2T and no single carbon source is known to support its growth, leaving key knowledge gaps in its metabolism and nutritional needs. Here, we report comparative genomic analysis of the draft genome of T. hugenholtzii JAD2T and eight closely related metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from geothermal sites in China, Japan, and the United States, representing “Candidatus Thermoflexus japonica,” “Candidatus Thermoflexus tengchongensis,” and “Candidatus Thermoflexus sinensis.” Genomics was integrated with targeted exometabolomics and 13C metabolic probing of T. hugenholtzii. The Thermoflexus genomes each code for complete central carbon metabolic pathways and an unusually high abundance and diversity of peptidases, particularly Metallo- and Serine peptidase families, along with ABC transporters for peptides and some amino acids. The T. hugenholtzii JAD2T exometabolome provided evidence of extracellular proteolytic activity based on the accumulation of free amino acids. However, several neutral and polar amino acids appear not to be utilized, based on their accumulation in the medium and the lack of annotated transporters. Adenine and adenosine were scavenged, and thymine and nicotinic acid were released, suggesting interdependency with other organisms in situ. Metabolic probing of T. hugenholtzii JAD2T using 13C-labeled compounds provided evidence of oxidation of glucose, pyruvate, cysteine, and citrate, and functioning glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid (TCA), and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathways (PPPs). However, differential use of position-specific 13C-labeled compounds showed that glycolysis and the TCA cycle were uncoupled. Thus, despite the high abundance of Thermoflexus in sediments of some geothermal systems, they appear to be highly focused on chemoorganotrophy, particularly protein degradation, and may interact extensively with other microorganisms in situ.",

		"abstract": "Bacteria belong to the key players in the carbon cycling in forest soils and thus affect the global C balance. Our understanding of bacterial contribution to ecosystem processes relies on the analysis of whole communities. Here we combined strain isolation, genome sequencing and metatranscriptomics to analyse the activity of individual bacterial species in the topsoil of a temperate coniferous forest. Our results show that transcription profiles in litter and soil differ, indicating that bacterial activity is shaped by their habitat. Importantly, transcript pools also significant differ between summer when primary producers are active and winter. We show that Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes with high metabolic capacity for polysaccharide decomposition in their genomes actively transcribe corresponding genes in situ. The rate of the transcription of ribosomal proteins, a proxy of growth, seasonally differs between these “decomposer” taxa and other “opportunistic” bacteria. While the former grow at similar rates in summer and winter, the latter grow much faster in summer when labile C, delivered by plant roots, is available. This paper demonstrates differences in activity of bacterial guilds as well as the importance of environmental drivers for the activity of individual bacteria.",

Fate of tree root necromass depends on fungal communities developing on the decaying roots. Local environmental conditions which affect composition of tree root mycobiome may also influence fungal communities developing on decaying tree roots. Here, we assessed fungal communities associated with decaying roots of Picea abies decomposing in three microhabitats: soil with no vegetation, soil with ericoid shrubs cover, and P. abies deadwood, for a 2-year period. Forest microhabitat showed stronger effect on structuring fungal communities associated with decaying roots compared to living roots. Some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi showed higher relative abundance on decaying roots in soils under ericoid shrub cover, while saprotrophic fungi had higher relative abundance in roots decomposing inside deadwood. Regardless of the studied microhabitat, we observed decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi and increase of endophytic fungi during root decomposition. Interestingly, we found substantially more fungal taxa with unknown ecology in late stages of root decomposition, indicating that highly decomposed roots may represent so far overlooked niche for soil fungi. Our study shows the importance of microhabitats on the fate of the decomposing spruce roots.",

		"abstract": "Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle, and the identification of active microbial decomposers is essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils.",

		"abstract": "Forest management practices often severely affect forest ecosystem functioning. Tree removal by clearcutting is one such practice, producing severe impacts due to the total reduction of primary productivity. Here, we assessed changes to fungal community structure and decomposition activity in the soil, roots and rhizosphere of a Picea abies stand for a 2-year period following clearcutting compared to data from before tree harvest. We found that the termination of photosynthate flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound changes in soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community composition. The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist and starts to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate from bulk soil and develop into hotspots of decomposition and important fungal biomass pools. We found no support for the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition of roots, but we found some evidence that root endophytic fungi may have an important role in the early stages of this process. In soil, activity of extracellular enzymes also decreased in the long term following the end of rhizodeposition by tree roots.",

		"abstract": "Multi-marker metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate biodiversity information across different domains of life from microbes to fungi to animals such as for molecular ecology and biomonitoring applications in different sectors from academic research to regulatory agencies and industry. Current popular bioinformatic pipelines support microbial and fungal marker analysis, while ad hoc methods are often used to process animal metabarcode markers from the same study. MetaWorks provides a harmonized processing environment, pipeline, and taxonomic assignment approach for demultiplexed Illumina reads for all biota using a wide range of metabarcoding markers such as 16S, ITS, and COI. A Conda environment is provided to quickly gather most of the programs and dependencies for the pipeline. Several workflows are provided such as: taxonomically assigning exact sequence variants, provides an option to generate operational taxonomic units, and facilitates single-read processing. Pipelines are automated using Snakemake to minimize user intervention and facilitate scalability. All pipelines use the RDP classifier to provide taxonomic assignments with confidence measures. We extend the functionality of the RDP classifier for taxonomically assigning 16S (bacteria), ITS (fungi), and 28S (fungi), to also support COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (eukaryotes, land plants, diatoms), 12S (fish, vertebrates), 18S (eukaryotes, diatoms) and ITS (fungi, plants). MetaWorks properly handles ITS by trimming flanking conserved rRNA gene regions as well as protein coding genes by providing two options for removing obvious pseudogenes.

		"abstract": "The analysis of microbiological and metabolic features of soils is an important aspect of soil ecology, but the results can be heavily impacted by sample storage conditions. Inconsistencies in storage methods and length of storage across studies reduce the ability to accurately collect field-based measures and compare results between projects. In this study, we examined the effects of various storage conditions and storage time on results of subsequent bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and on activities of extracellular enzymes, using soil samples collected from three different land use types (annual cropping system, native rangeland, and riparian forest) in a semi-arid region of the Canadian Prairies. We found that when comparing enzyme activities and bacterial communities across different land use types, storage conditions may not have a significant impact. However, storage conditions were found to be important within a single land use type. Air-drying of soil samples caused significant shifts in enzyme activity and β-diversity from the controls. Storage at −80 °C was best for maintaining consistent enzyme activity and microbial α- and β-diversity compared to controls (i.e., freshly collected soil) across all three land use types and storage times. The results from this study provide useful information about the impact of sample storage conditions for researchers in similar climates and encourage further consideration and discussion of the impacts of sample storage, as well as the reporting of storage conditions used in future studies.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Stream temperature is a critical control on aquatic habitat and a key forest management concern in many jurisdictions. Most research on stream temperature response to forest harvesting is from coniferous forests in rain-dominated watersheds and focused on the first few years following harvesting. In contrast, we know less about the harvesting impacts on stream temperature for silviculture approaches typically used in northern hardwood forests that are influenced by snow. We addressed this knowledge gap by using four decades (1980 to 2020) of spot water temperature measurements recorded at three treatment and two reference catchments (areas 4.5 to 69 ha) as part of a long-term water quality monitoring program at the Turkey Lakes Watershed study near the eastern shores of Lake Superior. We were able to control for diel and seasonal biases in the spot temperature measurements and found that clearcut harvesting showed a summer temperature increase that persisted for 5 to 7?years after harvesting. Shelterwood and selection harvest did not exhibit a detectable change in stream temperature. These responses are consistent with observed changes in forest canopy through time and between harvesting approaches. In addition, the stream temperature responses were likely muted due to the streams being short and characterized by intermittent flow conditions, as well as the potential moderating influence of increased subsurface runoff following harvesting. Our results highlight how insights can be extracted from routine water quality programs that were hitherto unrecognized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Deriving land cover from remotely sensed data is fundamental to many operational mapping and reporting programs as well as providing core information to support science activities. The ability to generate land cover maps has benefited from free and open access to imagery, as well as increased storage and computational power. The accuracy of the land cover maps is directly linked to the calibration (or training) data used, the predictors and ancillary data included in the classification model, and the implementation of the classification, among other factors (e.g., classification algorithm, land cover heterogeneity). Various means for improving calibration data can be implemented, including using independent datasets to further refine training data prior to mapping. Opportunities also arise from a profusion of possible calibration datasets from pre-existing land cover products (static and time series) and forest inventory maps through to observation from airborne and spaceborne lidar observations. In this research, for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada, we explored approaches to refine calibration data, integrate novel predictors, and optimize classifier implementation. We refined calibration data using measures of forest vertical structure, integrated novel spatial (via distance-to metrics) model predictors, and implemented a regionalized approach for optimizing training data selection and model-building to ensure local relevance of calibration data and capture of regional variability in land cover conditions. We found that additional vetting of training data involved the removal of 44.7% of erroneous samples (e.g. treed vegetation without vertical structure) from the training pool. Nationally, distance to ephemeral waterbodies was a key predictor of land cover, while the importance of distance to permanent water bodies varied on a regional basis. Regionalization of model implementation ensured that classification models used locally relevant descriptors and resulted in improved classification outcomes (overall accuracy: 77.9% ± 1.4%) compared to a generalized, national model (70.3% ± 2.5%). The methodological developments presented herein are portable to other land cover projects, monitoring programs, and remotely sensed data sources. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data for land cover mapping, as well as non-image data for aiding with model development (from cali­ bration data to complementary spatial data layers) provide new opportunities to improve and further automate land cover mapping procedures.",

However, whether differences in shortterm sample storage conditions impact the assessment of bacterial community composition and diversity requires systematic and quantitative assessment. Therefore, we used barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to survey communities, harvested from a variety of habitats [soil, human gut (feces) and human skin] and subsequently stored at 20, 4, À 20 and À 80 1C for 3 and 14 days. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic structure and diversity of communities in individual samples were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the storage temperature or the duration of storage. Likewise, the relative abundances of most taxa were largely unaffected by temperature even after 14 days of storage. Our results indicate that environmental factors and biases in molecular techniques likely confer greater amounts of variation to microbial communities than do differences in short-term storage conditions, including storage for up to 2 weeks at room temperature. These results suggest that many samples collected and stored under ﬁeld conditions without refrigeration may be useful for microbial community analyses.",

Here we use shotgun metagenomics to rigorously evaluate the technical and compositional reproducibility of five room temperature (RT) microbial stabilisation methods compared to the best practice of flash-freezing. These methods included RNALater, OMNIGene-GUT, a dry BBL swab, LifeGuard, and a novel method for preserving faecal samples, a Copan FLOQSwab in an active drying tube (FLOQSwab-ADT). Each method was assessed using six replicate faecal samples from five participants, totalling 180 samples. The FLOQSwab-ADT performed best for both technical and compositional reproducibility, followed by RNAlater and OMNIgene-GUT. LifeGuard and the BBL swab had unpredictable outgrowth of\n              Escherichia\n              species in at least one replicate from each participant. We further evaluated the FLOQSwab-ADT in an additional 239 samples across 10 individuals after storage at −20 °C, RT, and 50 °C for four weeks compared to fresh controls. The FLOQSwab-ADT maintained its performance across all temperatures, indicating this method is an excellent alternative to existing RT stabilisation methods.",

In this article we define the notion of “sampling fraction” and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (\n              ANCOM-BC\n              ), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.",

		"abstract": "Abandoned unrestored mines are an important environmental concern as they typically remain unvegetated for decades, exposing vast amounts of mine waste to erosion. Several factors limit the revegetation of these sites, including extreme abiotic and unfavorable biotic conditions. However, some pioneer tree species having high levels of genetic diversity, such as balsam poplar\n              (Populus balsamifera)\n              , can naturally colonize these sites and initiate plant succession. This suggests that some tree genotypes are likely more suited for acclimation to the conditions of mine wastes. In this study, we selected two contrasting mine waste storage facilities (waste rock from a gold mine and tailings from a molybdenum mine) from the Abitibi region of Quebec (Canada), on which poplars were found to have grown naturally. First, we assessed\n              in situ\n              the impact of vegetation presence on each mine waste type. The presence of balsam poplars improved soil health locally by modifying the physicochemical properties (e.g., higher nutrient content and pH) of the mine wastes and causing an important shift in their bacterial and fungal community compositions, going from lithotrophic communities that dominate mine waste environments to heterotrophic communities involved in nutrient cycling. Next, in a greenhouse experiment we assessed the impact of plant genotype when grown in these mine wastes. Ten genotypes of\n              P. balsamifera\n              were collected locally, found growing either at the mine sites or in the surrounding natural forest. Tree growth was monitored over two growing seasons, after which the effects of genotype-by-environment interactions were assessed by measuring the physicochemical properties of the substrates and the changes in microbial community assembly. Although substrate type was identified as the main driver of rhizosphere microbiome diversity and community structure, a significant effect due to tree genotype was also detected, particularly for bacterial communities. Plant genotype also influenced aboveground tree growth and the physicochemical properties of the substrates. These results highlight the influence of balsam poplar genotype on the soil environment and the potential importance of tree genotype selection in the context of mine waste revegetation.",

Fungi are important symbionts in many ecosystems, and are potentially important members of the human microbiome, beyond those that can cause disease. To expand our analysis of microbial communities to include fungal ITS data, we compared five candidate DNA extraction kits against our standardized protocol for describing bacteria and archaea using 16S rRNA gene amplicon- and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. We present results considering a diverse panel of host-associated and environmental sample types, and comparing the cost, processing time, well-to-well contamination, DNA yield, limit of detection, and microbial community composition among protocols. Across all criteria, we found the MagMAX Microbiome kit to perform best. The PowerSoil Pro kit performed comparably, but with increased cost per sample and overall processing time. The Zymo MagBead, NucleoMag Food, and Norgen Stool kits were included., Microbial communities contain a broad diversity of organisms, however most methods only describe certain groups such as bacteria, ignoring things like fungi. Fungi are important players in many ecosystems, and probably have a role in the human microbiome, beyond those that can cause disease. To expand our framework for looking at microbial communities to include data for fungi, we compared five commercial kits for extracting DNA from microbes against our old protocol (the one that only describes certain groups) sequencing capable of capturing all organisms. We present results considering a broad selection of samples from human stool to computer keyboards, and compared the cost, processing time, level of contamination, DNA yield, ability to detect cells, and microbial community composition among kits., To allow for downstream applications involving fungi in addition to bacteria and archaea, we compared five DNA extraction kits with our previously established, standardized protocol for extracting DNA for microbial community analysis. Across ten diverse sample types, we found one extraction kit to perform comparably or better than our standardized protocol. Our conclusion is based on per-sample comparisons of DNA yield, the number of quality-filtered sequences generated, the limit of detection of microbial cells, microbial community alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and taxonomic composition, and extent of well-to-well contamination.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with \"small n large p\" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.\nRESULTS: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.\nCONCLUSION: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.",

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R.

		"abstract": "Better soil disinfestation methods, such as biological soil disinfestation (BSD), that are environmentally safe are increasingly been developed and used because of rising concerns related to environmental risks. We evaluated the efficacy of soil disinfestation using ethanol to control the fungus Fusarium\noxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, which causes fusarium wilt of tomato. Survival of bud cells and chlamydospores declined markedly in soil saturated with diluted ethanol solution in the laboratory. In field trials, artificially added nonpathogenic Fusarium\noxysporum and indigenous F. oxysporum were both strongly suppressed in soil saturated with 1% ethanol solution; a wheat bran treatment was not as effective. The artificially added fungus was not detected in three of four sites treated with ethanol but was detected in three of four sites amended with wheat bran. Using ethanol in pre-autoclaved soil was not suppressive; thus native microorganisms are essential for the suppression. This ethanol-mediated biological soil disinfestation (Et-BSD) temporarily increased the number of anaerobic bacteria, but the number of fungi and aerobic bacteria was stable. Polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) analysis revealed slight but apparent differences in bacterial community structures in the soil treated with Et-BSD compared with the structure in soils after other treatments such as water irrigation and in the control soil, which received neither organic amendment nor irrigation after 15 days. Et-BSD is a potentially effective and easy soil disinfestation method, and its impact on native, beneficial microorganisms is moderate.",

This study aims at evaluating the effect of different storage conditions, including freezing, adding two liquid-based preservatives or simply storing samples with no preservative, on the structure of the microbial communities in aliquots of organic-rich soil and water samples as revealed by a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The results showed that the number of terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) detected in soil aliquots stored with LifeGuard™ solution was significantly lower than that of samples analyzed immediately after sampling. Moreover, cluster and PCA analyses showed that soil aliquots stored using LifeGuard™ clustered separately from those stored with the other methods. Conversely, soil and water aliquots stored with DMSO–EDTA–salt solution did not show either significant reduction in the number of TRFs or any change in the structure of the microbial community. Finally, the number of TRFs and the structure of microbial communities from soil aliquots stored with no preservative did not differ from those of aliquots analyzed immediately after sampling. Preservation methods should therefore be accurately evaluated before collecting samples that have to be stored for long time before DNA extraction.",

During field work it is not always possible to analyze fresh samples immediately or store them frozen. Therefore, the effect of short-term storage temperature was investigated on the abundance and composition of bacterial, archaeal and denitrifying communities in environmental samples from two different sampling sites. Oxic forest soil and anoxic pond sediment were investigated by measuring microbial abundance (DNA) and transcriptional activity (RNA). Prior to investigating the effect of storage temperature, samples were immediately analyzed, in order to represent the original situation in the habitat. The effect of storage temperature was then determined after 11 days at different low temperatures (room temperature, 4°C, −22°C and −80°C). Community profiling using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) showed no significant differences between the immediately analyzed reference sample and the samples stored at different incubation temperatures, both for DNA and RNA extracts. The abundance of microbial communities was determined using quantitative PCR and it also revealed a stable community size at all temperatures tested. By contrast, incubation at an elevated temperature (37°C) resulted in changed bacterial community composition. In conclusion, short-term storage, even at room temperature, did not affect microbial community composition, abundance and transcriptional activity in aerated forest soil and anoxic pond sediment.",

To overcome this difficulty, we hypothesized that adding absolute ethanol to soil samples could be as successful to preserve bacteria as it is to preserve insect or tissue samples for molecular studies. In an attempt to test this assumption, we compared four conservation conditions. After inoculation of soil samples with Escherichia coli, they were either kept at 28 °C, stored in the cold (4 °C), dried at 60 °C, or treated with absolute ethanol. The relative effectiveness of the methods was evaluated by using both DNA recoveries and bacterial 16S rDNA amplification as criteria. Two kinds of soils, i.e. sandy clay and clayey soil, were used. Soil conservation was tested for seven time periods ranging from 2 d to 1 year after bacterial inoculation. Results showed that cold conservation or addition of absolute ethanol to the samples yielded similar DNA recoveries. For these treatments, successful amplifications are still obtained after one year of conservation. The ethanol conservation of soil samples appears to be the easiest method to preserve the bacterial DNA because of its reliability and field convenience.",

		"abstract": "Drought alters carbon (C) allocation within trees, thereby impairing tree growth. Recovery of root and leaf functioning and prioritized C supply to sink tissues after drought may compensate for drought-induced reduction of assimilation and growth. It remains unclear if C allocation to sink tissues during and following drought is controlled by altered sink metabolic activities or by the availability of new assimilates. Understanding such mechanisms is required to predict forests’ resilience to a changing climate. We investigated the impact of drought and drought release on C allocation in a 100-y-old Scots pine forest. We applied 13CO2 pulse labeling to naturally dry control and long-term irrigated trees and tracked the fate of the label in above- and belowground C pools and fluxes. Allocation of new assimilates belowground was ca. 53% lower under nonirrigated conditions. A short rainfall event, which led to a temporary increase in the soil water content (SWC) in the topsoil, strongly increased the amounts of C transported belowground in the nonirrigated plots to values comparable to those in the irrigated plots. This switch in allocation patterns was congruent with a tipping point at around 15% SWC in the response of the respiratory activity of soil microbes. These results indicate that the metabolic sink activity in the rhizosphere and its modulation by soil moisture can drive C allocation within adult trees and ecosystems. Even a subtle increase in soil moisture can lead to a rapid recovery of belowground functions that in turn affects the direction of C transport in trees.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol is a ubiquitous environmental stressor that is toxic to all lifeforms. Here, we use the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that exposure to sublethal ethanol concentrations causes DNA replication stress and an increased mutation rate. Specifically, we find that ethanol slows down replication and affects localization of Mrc1, a conserved protein that helps stabilize the replisome. In addition, ethanol exposure also results in the recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases to the replication fork. Interestingly, preventing this recruitment through mutagenesis of the PCNA/Pol30 polymerase clamp or deleting specific error-prone polymerases abolishes the mutagenic effect of ethanol. Taken together, this suggests that the mutagenic effect depends on a complex mechanism, where dysfunctional replication forks lead to recruitment of error-prone polymerases. Apart from providing a general mechanistic framework for the mutagenic effect of ethanol, our findings may also provide a route to better understand and prevent ethanol-associated carcinogenesis in higher eukaryotes.",

In contrast to the well-established effects of elevated ethanol concentrations on bacteria, little is known about the consequences of exposure to VLEC. We supplemented growth media for Staphylococcus aureus strain DSM20231 with VLEC (VLEC+ conditions) and determined ultramorphology, growth, and viability compared to those with unsupplemented media (VLEC− conditions) for prolonged culture times (up to 8 days). VLEC+-grown late-stationary-phase S. aureus displayed extensive alterations of cell integrity as shown by scanning electron microscopy. Surprisingly, while ethanol in the medium was completely metabolized during exponential phase, a profound delay of S. aureus post-stationary-phase recovery (>48 h) was observed. Concomitantly, under VLEC+ conditions, the concentration of acetate in the culture medium remained elevated while that of ammonia was reduced, contributing to an acidic culture medium and suggesting decreased amino acid catabolism. Interestingly, amino acid depletion was not uniformly affected: under VLEC+ conditions, glutamic acid, ornithine, and proline remained in the culture medium while the uptake of other amino acids was not affected. Supplementation with arginine, but not with other amino acids, was able to restore post-stationary-phase growth and viability. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VLEC have profound effects on the recovery of S. aureus even after ethanol depletion and delay the transition from primary to secondary metabolite catabolism. These data also suggest that the concentration of ethanol needed for bacteriostatic control of S. aureus is lower than that previously reported.",

The purified recombinant Xyn11-1 showed its maximal activity at pH 6.0, and retained more than 60.4% of activity at pH 10.0, with good pH stability. Its optimal temperature was 50 °C and it was stable after incubation for 1 h at 30 °C. Furthermore, Xyn11-1 was highly salt-tolerant, retaining more than 77.4% of activity in the presence of 0.25-4 M NaCl and displaying more than 47.2% relative activity after being incubated in the presence of 5 M NaCl at 37 °C for 10 min. In addition, 5 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, Cu2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ increased the xylanase activity by 22.3%, 8.8%, 7.1%, and 4.4%, respectively. Significantly, 93.4% and 59.8% of the optimal activity was retained in the presence of 2% and 10% (v/v) ethanol, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the Km,Vmax, and Kcat value of Xyn11-1 for beechwood xylan were 3.7 mg ml-1, 101.0 μmol min-1 mg-1 and 42.1 s-1, respectively. Xyn11-1 is a strict endo-β-1,4-xylanase, its main enzymatic products being xylotetraose and xylopentaose. Xyn11-1 is the first reported GH11 xylanase isolated from saline-alkali soil, and has excellent tolerance of high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol, which indicates its great potential for basic research and industrial applications.",

A total seventy-five fungal morphotypes were isolated from these sites and out of them, only fifteen isolates were capable of utilizing ethanol (0-8%; v:v) as a sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Ten percent ethanol was completely lethal for the growth of all the isolated fungus. Biochemical characterization of the potent ethanol utilizing fungal isolates was studied based on substrate utilization profiles using BIOLOG phenotype microarray plates. Based on the morphological characters and Internal Transcribed Spacer region of ribosomal DNA, the fungal isolates were identified as Fusarium brachygibbosum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium acuminatum, Pencillium citrinum, Alternaria tenuissima, Septogloeum mori, Hypocrea lixii, Aureobasidium sp., Penicillium sp., and Fusarium sp. Intra-species genetic diversity among Fusarium sp. was evaluated by whole genome analysis with repetitive DNA sequences (ERIC, REP and BOX) based DNA fingerprinting. It was found that these fungus use alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes based metabolism pathway to utilize ethanol for their growth and colonization.",

		"abstract": "Soil drying and rewetting represents a common physiological stress for the microbial communities residing in surface soils. A drying-rewetting cycle may induce lysis in a significant proportion of the microbial biomass and, for a number of reasons, may directly or indirectly influence microbial community composition. Few studies have explicitly examined the role of drying-rewetting frequency in shaping soil microbial community structure. In this experiment, we manipulated soil water stress in the laboratory by exposing two different soil types to 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 15 drying-rewetting cycles over a 2-month period. The two soils used for the experiment were both collected from the Sedgwick Ranch Natural Reserve in Santa Ynez, CA, one from an annual grassland, the other from underneath an oak canopy. The average soil moisture content over the course of the incubation was the same for all samples, compensating for the number of drying-rewetting cycles. At the end of the 2-month incubation we extracted DNA from soil samples and characterized the soil bacterial communities using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. We found that drying-rewetting regimes can influence bacterial community composition in oak but not in grass soils. The two soils have inherently different bacterial communities; only the bacteria residing in the oak soil, which are less frequently exposed to moisture stress in their natural environment, were significantly affected by drying-rewetting cycles. The community indices of taxonomic diversity and richness were relatively insensitive to drying-rewetting frequency. We hypothesize that drying-rewetting induced shifts in bacterial community composition may partly explain the changes in C mineralization rates that are commonly observed following exposure to numerous drying-rewetting cycles. Microbial community composition may influence soil processes, particularly in soils exposed to a significant level of environmental stress.",

		"abstract": "Soil microbes face highly variable moisture conditions that force them to develop adaptations to tolerate or avoid drought. Drought conditions also limit the supply of vital substrates by inhibiting diffusion in dry conditions. How these biological and physical factors affect carbon (C) cycling in soils is addressed here by means of a novel process-based model. The model accounts for different microbial response strategies, including different modes of osmoregulation, drought avoidance through dormancy, and extra-cellular enzyme production. Diffusion limitations induced by low moisture levels for both extra-cellular enzymes and solutes are also described and coupled to the biological responses. Alternative microbial life-history strategies, each encoded in a set of model parameters, are considered and their effects on C cycling assessed both in the long term (steady state analysis) and in the short term (transient analysis during soil drying and rewetting). Drought resistance achieved by active osmoregulation requiring large C investment is not useful in soils where growth in dry conditions is limited by C supply. In contrast, dormancy followed by rapid reactivation upon rewetting seems to be a better strategy in such conditions. Synthesizing more enzymes may also be advantageous because it causes larger accumulation of depolymerized products during dry periods that can be used upon rewetting. Based on key model parameters, a spectrum of life-history strategies thus emerges, providing a possible classification of microbial responses to drought.",

		"abstract": "Throughout Earth’s history, drought has been a common crisis in terrestrial ecosystems; in human societies, it can cause famine, one of the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse. As the global hydrological cycle intensiﬁes with global warming, deeper droughts and rewetting will alter, and possibly transform, ecosystems. Soil communities, however, seem more tolerant than plants or animals are to water stress—the main effects, in fact, on soil processes appear to be limited diffusion and the limited supply of resources to soil organisms. Thus, the rains that end a drought not only release soil microbes from stress but also create a resource pulse that fuels soil microbial activity. It remains unclear whether the effects of drought on soil processes result from drying or rewetting. It is also unclear whether the ﬂush of activity on rewetting is driven by microbial growth or by the physical/ chemical processes that mobilize organic matter. In this review, I discuss how soil water, and the lack of it, regulates microbial life and biogeochemical processes. I ﬁrst focus on organismal-level responses and then consider how these inﬂuence whole-soil organic matter dynamics. A ﬁnal focus is on how to incorporate these effects into Earth System models that can effectively capture dry–wet cycling.",

Synthetic eDNA was added to soil microcosms, and its disappearance over time was measured using both high-throughput sequencing and qPCR. The synthetic eDNA was degraded rapidly, but a small fraction remained detectable throughout the experiments (39–80 days). The eDNA degradation rate was positively correlated with moisture and temperature, but negatively correlated with soil organic carbon content. End-point stabilization of eDNA was highest at low moisture and temperature, but exhibited no relationship with soil organic carbon. Tilled soils had higher rates of degradation and less stabilization than no-till soils. Among different habitats we observed that forest soils had the slowest degradation rate, and meadow soils had the greatest stabilization of eDNA. While eDNA was detectable by qPCR in all treatments across all time-points, it became inconsistently detectable with high-throughput gene sequencing in less than 1 week. We conclude that eDNA degradation and stabilization dynamics vary with moisture, temperature and habitat characteristics, that small amounts of eDNA may persist in soils indefinitely, and that the ability of persistent eDNA to impact microbial community estimates depends on method sensitivity and experimental objectives.",

		"abstract": "Desiccation is a common stress that bacteria face in the natural environment, and thus, they have developed a variety of protective mechanisms to mitigate the damage caused by water loss. The formation of biofilms and the accumulation of trehalose and sporulation are well-known strategies used by bacteria to survive desiccation. Other mechanisms, including intrinsically disordered proteins and the anti-glycation defence, have been mainly studied in eukaryotic cells, and their role in bacteria remains unclear. We have recently shown that the impairment of trehalose synthesis results in higher glucose availability, leading to the accumulation of acetyl phosphate and enhanced protein acetylation, which in turn stimulates protein aggregation. In the absence of trehalose synthesis, excess glucose may stimulate non-enzymatic glycosylation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) bound to proteins. Therefore, we propose that trehalose may prevent protein damage, not only as a chemical chaperone but also as a metabolite that indirectly counteracts detrimental protein acetylation and glycation.",

		"abstract": "Xerotolerant microorganisms are extremophiles that can survive in environments with extremely limited water availability. Despite their importance to these ecosystems, xerotolerant bacteria have been largely overlooked.A high diversity of xerotolerant bacteria can be found in many different extreme environments, including hot and cold environments, such as the Atacama and Antarctic deserts. In these biomes, xerotolerant microorganisms survive in sheltered geological niches that allow for biological activity.Dormancy and sporulation are common behavioural responses to desiccation that enable xerotolerant microorganisms to react to sporadic cycles of rainfall and drought by remaining in an inert metabolic state.Xerotolerant bacteria use several physiological mechanisms to prevent cell disruption and water loss, including phospholipid modifications to maintain membrane fluidity, the secretion of water-retaining extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and the accumulation of compatible solutes that preserve the osmotic potential across the membrane.For xerotolerant microorganisms, DNA and protein stability are crucial to ensure that cellular activity is resumed under favourable conditions. Consequently, most molecular adaptations to xeric stress involve the upregulation of proteins that are stable under low water activity and that preserve the integrity of DNA through physical protection and repair.Although xerotolerant bacteria are unique in their capacity to survive in environments in which water is scarce, many of the adaptive mechanisms that they use are also triggered by other abiotic stresses that are present in these environments. Therefore, these mechanisms are part of broader adaptive response that enables the survival of microorganisms in extreme biomes.",

		"abstract": "The microbial response to summer desiccation reflects adaptation strategies, setting the stage for a large rainfall-induced soil CO2 pulse upon rewetting, an important component of the ecosystem carbon budget. In three California annual grasslands, the present (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) soil bacterial and fungal communities were tracked over a summer season and in response to controlled rewetting of intact soil cores. Phylogenetic marker genes for bacterial (16S) and fungal (28S) RNA and DNA were sequenced, and the abundances of these genes and transcripts were measured. Although bacterial community composition differed among sites, all sites shared a similar response pattern of the present and potentially active bacterial community to dry-down and wet-up. In contrast, the fungal community was not detectably different among sites, and was largely unaffected by dry-down, showing marked resistance to dessication. The potentially active bacterial community changed significantly as summer dry-down progressed, then returned to pre-dry-down composition within several hours of rewetting, displaying spectacular resilience. Upon rewetting, transcript copies of bacterial rpoB genes increased consistently, reflecting rapid activity resumption. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla present and potentially active, and showed the largest changes in relative abundance. The relative increase (Actinobacteria) and decrease (Acidobacteria) with dry-down, and the reverse responses to rewetting reflected a differential response, which was conserved at the phylum level and consistent across sites. These contrasting desiccation-related bacterial life-strategies suggest that predicted changes in precipitation patterns may affect soil nutrient and carbon cycling by differentially impacting activity patterns of microbial communities.",

		"abstract": "Molecular methods, such as DNA barcoding, have the potential to enhance biomonitoring programs worldwide. Altering routinely used sample preservation methods to protect DNA from degradation may pose a potential impediment to application of DNA barcoding and metagenomics for biomonitoring using benthic macroinvertebrates. Using higher volumes or concentrations of ethanol, requirements for shorter holding times, or the need to include additional filtering may increase cost and logistical constraints to existing biomonitoring programs. To address this issue we evaluated the efficacy of various ethanol-based sample preservation methods at maintaining DNA integrity. We evaluated a series of methods that were minimally modified from typical field protocols in order to identify an approach that can be readily incorporated into existing monitoring programs. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from a minimally disturbed stream in southern California, USA and subjected to one of six preservation treatments. Ten individuals from five taxa were selected from each treatment and processed to produce DNA barcodes from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). On average, we obtained successful COI sequences (i.e. either full or partial barcodes) for between 93–99% of all specimens across all six treatments. As long as samples were initially preserved in 95% ethanol, successful sequencing of COI barcodes was not affected by a low dilution ratio of 2∶1, transfer to 70% ethanol, presence of abundant organic matter, or holding times of up to six months. Barcoding success varied by taxa, with Leptohyphidae (Ephemeroptera) producing the lowest barcode success rate, most likely due to poor PCR primer efficiency. Differential barcoding success rates have the potential to introduce spurious results. However, routine preservation methods can largely be used without adverse effects on DNA integrity.",

Existing studies have not arrived at a consensus on what the effects of wood ash amendments are on soil biota. We collected forest soil samples from studies in managed forests across Canada that were amended with wood ash to evaluate the effects on arthropod, bacterial and fungal communities using metabarcoding of F230, 16S, 18S and ITS2 sequences as well as enzyme analyses to assess its effects on soil biotic function. Ash amendment did not result in consistent effects across sites, and those effects that were detected were small. Overall, this study suggests that ash amendment applied to managed forest systems in amounts (up to 20 Mg ha\n              −1\n              ) applied across the 8 study sties had little to no detectable effects on soil biotic community structure or function. When effects were detected, they were small, and site-specific. These non-results support the application of wood ash to harvested forest sites to replace macronutrients (e.g., calcium) removed by logging operations, thereby diverting it from landfill sites, and potentially increasing stand productivity.",

		"abstract": "From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology",

		"abstract": "The purpose of our approach was to take into account the nested spatial scales driving stream functioning in the description of pressures/ecological status links by analysing the results of a hierarchical model. The development of this model has allowed us to answer the following questions: Does the consideration of the indirect links between anthropogenic pressures and stream ecological status modify the hierarchy of pressure types impacting benthic invertebrates? Do the different nested scales play different roles in the anthropogenic pressures/ecological status relationship? Does this model lead to better understanding of the specific role of hydromorphology in the evaluation of stream ecological status? To achieve that goal, we used the Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling method to develop a structural model linking variables describing (i) land use and hydromorphological alterations at the watershed scale, (ii) hydromorphological alterations at the reach scale, (iii) nutrients-organic matter contamination levels at the site scale, and (iv) substrate characteristics at the sampling site scale, to explain variation in values of a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index: the French I2M2. We have highlighted the importance of land use effects exerted on both hydromorphological and chemical characteristics of streams observed at finer scales and their subsequent indirect impact on stream ecological status. Hydromorphological alterations have an effect on the substrate mosaic structure and on the concentrations of nutrients and organic matter at site scale. This result implies that stream hydromorphology can have a major indirect effect on macroinvertebrate assemblages and that the hierarchy of impacts of anthropogenic pressures on stream ecological status generally described in the literature - often determining strategic restoration priorities - has to be re-examined. Finally, the effects of nutrients and organic matter on macroinvertebrate assemblages are lower than expected when all the indirect effects of land use and hydromorphological alterations are taken into account.",

As integrators of local catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41%) than synergistic (28%), additive (16%) or reversed (15%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adaptation to multiple stressors.",

After these forestry activities, incoming light, temperature, and nutrient content of the water increased significantly. Mean algal biomass peaked during the first summer after clear-cutting. During the first year following soil disturbance, algal biomass initially decreased because of turbidity, but began to rise again as suspended solids in the water decreased in the summer months. Species composition changed, too; after clear-cutting, Cryptomonas and Chlamydomonas species increased their densities (48% of the algal biomass) and following soil disturbance, the species numbers and densities of Conjugatophyceae (52% of the algal biomass) were higher than before. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that increased nutrient levels and acidity were the main factors behind the changes in the flora following clear-cutting. The most important effect of soil disturbance was the increased water temperature. Effects of forest clear-cutting on algal productivity in the brooks remain evident at least for three years and those of soil disturbance for an even longer period. Restricted clear-cutting, with a protective zone left uncut around the brooks, appears to reduce the effects. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

		"abstract": "1. The fundamental importance of freshwater resources, the rapid extinction rate among freshwater species and the pronounced sensitivity of freshwater ecosystems to climate change together signal a pre-eminent need for renewed scientific focus and greater resources. Against this background, the Freshwater Biological Association in 2008 launched a new series of ‘summit’ Conferences in Aquatic Biology intended to develop and showcase the application of ecological science to major issues in freshwater management. 2. This collection of studies arose from the first summit entitled ‘Multiple Stressors in Freshwater Ecosystems’. Although freshwater science and management are replete with mutiple-stressor problems, few studies have been designed explicitly to untangle their effects. 3. The individual case studies that follow reveal the wide array of freshwaters affected by multiple stressors, the spatial and temporal scales involved, the species and ecosystem processes affected, the complex interactions between ecology and socioeconomics that engender such effects, the approaches advocated to address the problems and the challenges of restoring affected systems. The studies also illustrate the extent to which new challenges are emerging (e.g. through climate change), but also they develop a vision of how freshwaters might be managed sustainably to offset multiple stressors in future. 4. More generically, these case studies illustrate (i) how freshwaters might be at particular risk of multiple-stressor effects because of conflicts in water use, and because the hydrological cycle vectors stressor effects so effectively and so extensively; (ii) that dramatic, nonlinear, ‘ecological surprises’ sometimes emerge as multiple-stressor effects develop and (iii) that good ecology and good ecologists add considerable value to other freshwater disciplines in understanding multiple stressors and managing their effects.",

		"abstract": "Ecological stressors (i.e., environmental factors outside their normal range of variation) can mediate each other through their interactions, leading to unexpected combined effects on communities. Determining whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the linear combination of their individual effects (i.e., an additive expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative null models that base their predictions on the effects of single stressors on community properties (e.g., species richness or biomass) do not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model, which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level. Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of ecological surprises on communities based on community property null models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the responses of individual species to the community level as does our compositional null model.",

		"abstract": "Freeze-thaw (FT) events can influence soil functions. However, the overall impact of FTs on soil bacterial communities, especially in temperate regions, remains unclear. In this study, soil samples were collected from a midtemperate region in the northeast of China, and three incubation tests were then designed with varied FT amplitudes (i.e., at a freezing temperature of −15, −9, and −3°C, respectively), frequencies of FT cycles (i.e., under one, six, and 15 FT cycles, respectively) and soil water content (SWC) values (i.e., at 10 and 30% SWC, respectively). High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed and the functional profile was further predicted based on these data, in addition to examinations of bulk microbial properties. Data analyses suggested that, first of all, the FT amplitude significantly influenced the bulk microbial properties and bacterial community (composition and function); certain taxa showed a nonlinear response to the three amplitudes. Next, compared to a single FTC, multiple FT cycles had only minor effects on the bacterial functional capabilities, although the bulk microbial properties changed significantly after multiple FT cycles. In addition, the bacterial response to FTs was influenced by the SWC, characterized by the significantly different bacterial community structures (composition and function) and the opposite trends of enzyme activities. Finally, RDA plots and a correlation network assembled data from all soil samples across the three tests and suggested that bacterial response trajectories changed because some species were influenced mainly by other species (i.e., biotic environment) during FT processes.",

		"abstract": "In drylands, soil microorganisms play a vital role in restoring degraded soils, and soil microbiota is significantly affected by human activities and climate events, such as seasonal freezing and thawing. However, the response of soil microbes to freezing and thawing, as well as their properties in drylands agroecosystems, remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of seasonal freezing and thawing on soil fungal and bacterial communities, multifunctionality, and soil microbial quality in a dryland agroecosystem. It has been observed that seasonal freezing and thawing promoted nutrient releases such as total carbon and available phosphorus. After thawing, soil catalase and cellulase activities increased while acid phosphatase and urease activities and total nitrogen content at topsoil decreased. Soil microbial biomass carbon content at 0–40 cm depth was significantly reduced by 94.77 %. Importantly, freezing and thawing considerably shifted the composition of fungal groups, while the soil bacterial community exhibited more stress tolerance to freezing-thawing. Compared to pre-freezing, the relative abundance of dominant fungal phyla such as Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota decreased. At the same time, Ascomycota increased after thawing, and the relative abundance of pathogenic fungus also increased. For dominant bacteria phylum, freezing and thawing increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes while Micrococcaceae declined. Freezing and thawing significantly increased bacterial diversity and evenness by 4.94 % and 4.19 %, respectively, but decreased fungal richness and diversity by 23.49 % and 14.91 %, respectively. The minimum and total data sets were used to evaluate soil quality and we found that freezing and thawing significantly negatively impacted soil multifunctionality and microbial quality. In summary, this study demonstrates that the seasonal freezing-thawing has a significant negative impact on soil microbial quality and multifunctionality, and accelerates soil degeneration in dryland agroecosystem.",

		"abstract": "Storage of samples is often an unavoidable step in environmental data collection, since available analytical capacity seldom permits immediate processing of large sample sets needed for representative data. In microbiological soil studies, sample pretreatments may have a strong influence on measurement results, and thus careful consideration is required in the selection of storage conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of prolonged (up to 16weeks) frozen or air-dried storage for divergent soil materials. The samples selected to this study were mineral soil (clay loam) from an agricultural field, humus from a pine forest and compost from a municipal sewage sludge composting field. The measured microbiological parameters included functional profiling with ten different hydrolysing enzyme activities determined by artificial fluorogenic substrates, and structural profiling with bacterial 16S rDNA community fingerprints by amplicon length heterogeneity analysis (LH-PCR). Storage of samples affected the observed fluorescence intensity of the enzyme assay's fluorophor standards dissolved in soil suspension. The impact was highly dependent on the soil matrix and storage method, making it important to use separate standardisation for each combination of matrix type, storage method and time. Freezing proved to be a better storage method than air-drying for all the matrices and enzyme activities studied. The effect of freezing on the enzyme activities was small (<20%) in clay loam and forest humus and moderate (generally 20–30%) in compost. The most dramatic decreases (>50%) in activity were observed in compost after air-drying. The bacterial LH-PCR community fingerprints were unaffected by frozen storage in all matrices. The effect of storage treatments was tested using a new statistical method based on showing similarity rather than difference of results.",

		"abstract": "Catchments, generally understood as the drainage areas of low-order streams, are often regarded as closed hydrologic entities; that is, precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET) over a catchment equates stream outflow (Q r). Here, we review evidence that catchments can be leaky due to groundwater outflow or inflow across topographic divides, based on catchment mass balance across a continent and several site-based studies across the globe. It appears that a catchment is more likely to be leaky with the combination of the following factors: small catchment size, positioned at either the high or low end of a steep regional topographic and climatic gradient, underlain by deep permeable substrates that extend beyond the study catchment, and in drier climate or dry seasons and droughts. Catchment leakage has hydrological, geochemical, and ecological implications. Thus, catchments are best framed as semiclosed hydrologic units perched on top of a larger, regional hydrogeological system with no real boundaries regarding the movement of water and solutes.

Identifying what factors are driving spatial patterns in stream communities is a central aim of ecology. 2. Here we used two large European data sets of fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms and environmental data in two stream groups (lowland and mountain) to determine the importance of variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional, local) on community structure. 3. Both geographical position and ecoregion were selected first in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), clearly showing the broad spatial gradients covered in the data set. Secondary predictors (after accounting for spatial and/or ecoregion effects) were similar between stream groups and among the four organism groups. In particular, conductivity and N concentration were strong predictors reflecting catchment land use. 4. Using partial CCA, we assessed the individual importance of the three spatial scales on the community structure of the four organism groups in the two stream groups. The majority of among-site variability (22–29%) was accounted for by local scale variables (e.g. water chemistry and substratum type), with regional and spatial variables accounting 11–13% and 5–6%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the four organism groups are responding similarly to the different levels of spatial scale, implying much redundancy which should be consider when implementing studies of bioassessment.",

Over the last 50 years, the volume of conifers in the Ozark region has increased 115% since 1978 which may result in the acidification of nearby aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine if differences exist in soil and litter chemical properties between deciduous and coniferous tree stands. Aboveground litter (n = 200) and soil (n = 400) at 0- to 5- and 5- to 15-cm depths were collected at paired deciduous and coniferous stands at 10 locations within the Mulberry River watershed and analyzed for a suite of chemical parameters. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in several measures of soil acidity between deciduous and coniferous stands. Litter collected from the coniferous stands was more acidic than deciduous litter (4.4 vs 4.7; P < 0.05). Cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Ca and Mg, and water-soluble P and Mg contents differed (P < 0.05) by stand and depth. Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable Ca and Mg were greatest in the 0- to 5-cm depth interval of the coniferous stands. Water-soluble P and Mg contents were greatest within the 0- to 5-cm depth interval which did not differ (P > 0.05) between stand but were greater than the 5- to 15-cm depth interval. Although limited to the top 15-cm of soil, the similarity in soil acidity between stands suggests that conifer growth may not be a substantial source of acidity to the Mulberry River.",

The same spacings produced quadratic mean diameters of 21 and 23 cm, respectively, compared with 18 cm in the unthinned stands. These size increases translated to individual stem volume gains of 33% and 62%, significantly reducing the age at which thinned stands would meet a specified minimum requirement for merchantability or habitat.

		"abstract": "The importance of biodiversity has become widely recognized but the best methods for conserving forest biodiversity are still being debated. Central to this debate is the influence of plantations and managed stands on local and landscape-scale biodiversity. A recent paper by Erdle and Pollard in The Forestry Chronicle (2002), which concluded that few plantations are strict monocultures in terms of the total number of tree species, could be interpreted as making the case that plantations have relatively minor consequences for biodiversity. We argue that: (1) it is not only the number of species, but also the identities and relative abundances of species that are of ecological importance, and (2) defining biodiversity in terms of tree species alone is of limited applicability. Existing research in New Brunswick on the impact of plantations on biodiversity at the stand scale reveals potentially significant biodiversity losses, at least in certain taxa. The proposal that incorporating more structural elements (e.g., snags, coarse woody debris, vertical structure) and retaining greater tree species diversity to ameliorate negative consequences of plantations remains a hypothesis to be tested in this region. Scientific information gathered in the following areas will allow better decision making: (1) to what degree are older plantations used by native species? (2) are productivity and survivorship of vertebrates in intensively managed stands similar to those in unmanaged forest? (3) are intensively managed stands suitable habitat for non-vertebrates? (4) are there thresholds in the response of some species to landscape-scale habitat loss caused by intensive forest management?Key words: plantations, biodiversity, species composition, landscape scale, stand structures",

A delayed (age 30 or 32 years) single-entry thinning and unthinned portions of the plantations served as references for the other treatments. With the exception of 50% systematic row thinnings, removal intensities were held relatively constant at about 40% of stand basal area. All of the thinning treatments satisfied the objectives of focusing diameter and volume growth on a reduced number of stems and making merchantable volume available during the rotation. Early single-entry thinning allowed 30–50 m3/ha to be harvested, increasing quadratic mean diameter and mean merchantable volume per stem at the end of the observation period by 10% and 24%, respectively, over unthinned stands. A second thinning removed an additional 48–64 m3/ha and increased diameter and volume gains to 25% and 71%, respectively. Only marginal differences were observed between the tree-selection strategies, and there were no overall gross total or gross merchantable volume gains or losses associated any of the thinning treatments relative to the unthinned plantations.",

		"abstract": "Forest plantations are viewed by some as a means to meet the world's escalating demand for wood, and by others as a threat to forest diversity and ecological function. With the purpose of improving planting practices, we analysed recently available data on 15- to 30-year-old plantations on public land in New Brunswick to identify tree species composition differences between plantations and the natural forest they replaced. Presently, 9% of the public forests in the province has been planted; at current planting rates, this will increase to 17% by the year 2030. Plantations established between 1967 and 1982 differ little from the natural forest they replaced in terms of total softwood content, but differ markedly by having much higher jack pine and much lower red spruce contents. There is evidence of reduced diversity evenness in plantations at the landscape level, but at the stand level few plantations are true monocultures and the abundance of high single-species dominance in plantations is very similar to that of the natural forests they replaced. All species composition comparisons between plantations and replaced natural forest vary strongly by ecoregion. To reduce the degree of difference between plantations and the natural forest, planting practices and prescriptions should (a) broaden the mix of species used, and use less jack pine and more red spruce and cedar, (b) employ a mix of species at the stand level, and (c) consider more fully the site conditions and natural species composition of ecological zones.Key words: plantations, tree species composition, forest simplification, tree species diversity, forest management",

		"abstract": "Pre-commercial (PCT) and commercial thinning (CT) are important silvicultural tools applied to spruce-fir (Picea-Abies) forests, a key forest type in the northeastern portion of North America. However, the long-term influences of CT, particularly when combined with PCT, are relatively unknown, except for a few specific locations in the region. Utilizing the repeated measurements from replicated experimental research sites (n = 15) initiated in the early 2000s throughout Maine, we quantified the influence of contrasting thinning treatments on spruce-fir stands with prior PCT and without a prior PCT (NoPCT). Thinning treatments at the nine sites with a prior PCT were a combination of multiple entry timings (immediate, 5-, and 10-year delay) and removal intensities (0, 33, and 50 % relative density reduction). At the six NoPCT sites, the CT treatments were a combination of thinning methods (dominant, crown, and low) and removal intensities (0, 33, and 50 %). The most effective CT in terms of large tree response, sawlog volume, and stand value were immediate CT rather than delayed treatments after PCT, and low thinning in NoPCT stands. Dominant thinning in NoPCT showed detrimental effects on residual stand conditions leading to the lowest yield and generated product values. In general, the earlier CT entry in PCT stands led to greater long-term benefits of the treatment in terms of tree size, merchantable volume, and financial value of the stand. No thinning treatment significantly enhanced cumulative total volume or merchantable volume or financial value compared to unthinned controls because even though thinning enhanced sawlog production, unthinned stands produced more pulpwood and studwood. Although we did not find significant economic benefits of CT in stands with or without PCT, light low thinning in NoPCT, and light crown thinning without delay in PCT could be an optimal strategy to maximize the average merchantable stem size without compromising the total stand value, while providing additional benefits to stand composition and generating mid-rotation revenue. Overall, the findings highlight some complexities and challenges with effective thinning regimes in highly shade-tolerant conifer species.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT. In a 15-year case study, we used the multiple streams approach (MSA) and the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) to examine a controversial industry-led proposal for increased harvest of Crown forests in New Brunswick, Canada, in an adversarial policy subsystem. Study participants were queried on their perceptions of policy problems and reasons for community attention, the relationship between science and policy, and whether policy decisions were consistent with scientific understanding. Thematic analysis was used to examine interview data for evidence of Kingdon’s MSA and Sabatier’s ACF. During public hearings of a Legislative Select Committee on Wood Supply, two competing policy alternatives emerged. The first, put forward by the forest industry coalition, advocated an intensive forest management approach in support of a competitive industry. The second, supported by the conservation coalition, largely made up of scientists and environmental groups, focused on adaptive management, an ecosystem approach, and greater public input. This counterproposal forestalled the industry from placing its proposal on the government 2005 decision agenda. However, in 2014, the government unexpectedly adopted essentially the same industry proposal. Although the MSA provided a better explanation of the factors critical to the 2014 policy change, i.e., a declining provincial economy and a change of key government personnel, the ACF offered a nuanced perspective on the need for a professional forum to facilitate policy-oriented learning across competing coalitions. In 2014, the lack of such a forum and a closed process limited policy alternatives considered by elected officials. Results also emphasize the importance of how legislators choose to interact with experts and scientists, particularly within an adversarial subsystem, especially when a powerful coalition develops ways to limit the access to decision makers by competing coalitions.",

		"abstract": "Predicting forest composition change through time is a key challenge in forest management. While multiple successional pathways are theorized for boreal forests, empirical evidence is lacking, largely because succession has been inferred from chronosequence and dendrochronological methods. We tested the hypotheses that stands of compositionally similar overstory may follow multiple successional pathways depending on time since last stand-replacing fire (TSF), edaphic conditions, and presence of intermediate disturbances. We used repeated measurements from combining sequential aerial photography and ground surveys for 361 boreal stands in central Canada. Stands were measured in 8–15 yr intervals over a 60 yr period, covering a wide range of initial stand conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze stand type transitions. With increasing TSF, stands dominated by shade-intolerant Pinus banksiana, Populus sp., and Betula papyrifera demonstrated multiple pathways to stands dominated by shade-tolerant Picea sp., Abies balsamea, and Thuja occidentalis. Their pathways seemed largely explained by neighborhood effects. Succession of stands dominated by shade-tolerant species, with an exception of stands dominated by Picea sp., was not related to TSF, but rather dependent on edaphic conditions and presence of intermediate disturbances. Varying edaphic conditions caused divergent pathways with resource limited sites being dominated by nutrient-poor tolerant species, and richer sites permitting invasion of early successional species and promoting species mixtures during succession. Intermediate disturbances promoted deciduous persistence and species diversity in A. balsamea and mixed-conifer stands, but no evidence was detected to support “disturbance accelerated succession”. Our results demonstrate that in the prolonged absence of stand-replacing disturbance boreal forest stands undergo multiple succession pathways. These pathways are regulated by neighborhood effects, resource availability, and presence of intermediate disturbance, but the relative importance of these regulators depends on initial stand type. The observed divergence of successional pathways supports the resource-ratio hypothesis of plant succession.",

		"abstract": "The New England – Acadian Forest (NEAF) is an ecoregion spanning 24 million hectares of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The region is characterized as a transitional forest naturally composed of both boreal and temperate species. The term “borealization” is sometimes used to describe various processes driving the NEAF toward a more boreal character at the expense of its temperate forest species and ecological communities. That the NEAF has undergone significant landscape-scale change in the last four centuries since European settlement is well understood. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the literature on the forest composition and dynamics of this region to investigate whether past, current, and (or) predicted future processes of change are indeed driving the forest toward a more boreal character. We examine studies on the historical forest composition and impacts of past and current land-use practices, as well as indirect anthropogenic changes that are predicted to influence future forest compositions of the NEAF. We review over 100 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and government reports related to this issue. We find ample evidence to suggest that, at the landscape scale, there has been widespread replacement of temperate tree species by boreal species since European settlement. Five primary drivers have facilitated borealization across the NEAF: logging and high-grading, natural reforestation of abandoned farmland, industrial clearcutting, anthropogenic fire, and boreal conifer plantations. Furthermore, the borealization of the NEAF has continued to occur in direct contrast to the predicted impacts of climate change. We encourage future scholarship to tackle these aspects of borealization in the NEAF, including its social, economic, and ecological implications.",

		"abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems are fuelled by biogeochemical inputs from surrounding lands and within-lake primary production. Disturbances that change these inputs may affect how aquatic ecosystems function and deliver services vital to humans. Here we test, using a forest cover gradient across eight separate catchments, whether disturbances that remove terrestrial biomass lower organic matter inputs into freshwater lakes, thereby reducing food web productivity. We focus on deltas formed at the stream-lake interface where terrestrial-derived particulate material is deposited. We find that organic matter export increases from more forested catchments, enhancing bacterial biomass. This transfers energy upwards through communities of heavier zooplankton, leading to a fourfold increase in weights of planktivorous young-of-the-year fish. At least 34% of fish biomass is supported by terrestrial primary production, increasing to 66% with greater forest cover. Habitat tracers confirm fish were closely associated with individual catchments, demonstrating that watershed protection and restoration increase biomass in critical life-stages of fish.",

		"abstract": "The issue of calcium (Ca) decline in surface waters of eastern Canada is an emerging concern that may be made worse by timber harvesting. In the Muskoka River Watershed (MRW) in Ontario, the mean lake Ca concentration in 104 lakes decreased by 30% since the 1980s, with the rate of decrease slowing over time consistent with changes in lake sulfate (SO4) as the region recovers from acid deposition. Recent data suggested that smaller lakes, at higher elevation, in smaller catchments with higher runoff that are minimally impacted by the influence of roads and agriculture are associated with lower Ca concentrations and thus are the lakes most at risk of amplified Ca depletion. Using proposed annual allowable harvest cuts from 10-year forest management plans, 38% of 364 lakes assessed in the MRW will fall below a reported critical 1 mg·L–1 Ca threshold compared with just 8% in the absence of future harvesting. It is concluded that Ca decline poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems and should be taken into consideration in future forest management plans.",

In order to assess the nutrient status of soils in central Ontario, input–output budgets for calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) were calculated over a 17-year period (1983–1999) for a coniferous catchment in the Muskoka-Haliburton region. Inputs through deposition and weathering (BCs only), were compared with outputs through stream export and net accumulation in forest biomass. Despite a lack of forest growth at PC1, annual NO3–N concentrations in the stream were low (<0.1 mg/l) over the 17-year period, and over 80% of the atmospheric N input was retained in the catchment, indicating this catchment has not reached N-saturation. Stream export of Mg, and in particular Ca, exceeded input of these elements through deposition and weathering, indicating a net loss from the catchment over the 17-year period. Mass balance calculations indicated there was no net loss of K from the catchment. Soil re-sampling measurements confirmed large losses of Ca, but not Mg, and there were significant decreases in both NaCl-exchangeable Ca concentrations and soil pH between 1983 and 1999. The measured decline in soil Ca concentration amounted to a loss of approximately 85 kg/ha Ca from the exchangeable pool over the 17-year period. Similarly, input–output budget calculations indicated a net loss of Ca from the catchment in the range of 76 to 88 kg/ha between 1983 and 1999. Although the magnitude of Ca export decreased over the 17-year period, current stream export continues to exceed Ca input through deposition and weathering.",

		"abstract": "Clearcut forest harvesting typically results in large changes in stream water chemistry in northeastern North America. The effects of partial forest harvests on stream chemistry have not received as much attention, even though partial cutting is a more common forestry practice than clearcutting in this region. Changes in stream water chemistry following a partial cut are reported here from a 10ha study catchment in a northern hardwood forest in the Catskill Mountains of southern New York, and are compared to those of a nearby 48ha reference catchment. The lower two thirds of the treatment catchment was harvested in February–April 2002 by a shelterwood method, such that 33% of the basal area of the catchment was removed. Stream NO3−, NH4+, Ca2+, K+, and total dissolved aluminum (Alto) concentrations increased significantly after the harvest. Stream Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+ concentrations peaked 5 months after the initiation of the harvest, NO3− and K+ concentrations peaked 6 months after cutting, and Alto concentrations peaked 1 year after cutting. Streamflow was not significantly affected by the harvest when compared to the flow of three nearby streams. Export of NO3− in stream water increased five-fold the year after the cut, and briefly exceeded atmospheric inputs of inorganic nitrogen during 4 months in the fall of 2002. Changes in stream NO3− and K+ concentrations were less than predicted by the relative basal area removed compared with those of a recent nearby clearcut. In contrast, changes in Ca2+, Mg2+ and Alto concentrations were approximately proportional to basal area removal in these two cuts. Stream chemistry returned to values close to those of the pre-cut period and to reference values by early spring of 2003, just over a year after the initiation of the harvest, except for NO3− concentrations, which remained elevated above background 18–20 months after completion of the cut.",

		"abstract": "Calcium (Ca) concentrations in surface waters on the Precambrian Shield are determined primarily by the Ca weathering rate in soil, which requires extensive soil data that generally do not exist. From a water chemistry database comprising approximately 550 lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada, 130 lakes were selected with low Ca concentrations (Ca < 75 µmol·L–1). Calcium weathering is primarily dominated by silicate minerals such as plagioclase and hornblende, allowing the use of Ca–sodium (Na) ratios in lake water to estimate Ca weathering rates. Soil profile data at seven sites indicated that the Ca–Na ratio from mineral weathering is 0.86; correspondingly, Ca weathering rates in lakes ranged from 0.04 to 0.24 kmol·ha–1·year–1 (median of 0.09 kmol·ha–1·year–1). This compares with a range of 0.06–0.24 kmol·ha–1·year–1 (median of 0.14 kmol·ha–1·year–1) obtained using the steady-state water chemistry model. Using these methods to bound potential weathering rates, Ca concentrations in individual lakes at steady state are predicted to decline by 10%–40% compared with current values. Dynamic soil hydrochemical model predictions indicate that Ca concentrations in lakes will be considerably lower than these steady-state predictions within decades if timber harvesting occurs in the drainage basins.",

		"abstract": "Declining concentrations of Ca and other base cations in soils and surface waters in eastern North America have led to concerns that forests may become nutrient limited, particularly in regions that are harvested. We constructed a nutrient budget for a selection harvest in central Ontario that is typical of eastern North America. Atmospheric deposition (5-year average) and mineral weathering (PROFILE) were considered as the sole inputs to the forest, while exports included nutrient losses in streams and removed in stems. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) was the only tree species removed in the study (∼30% of basal area) and harvesting had no strong impact on stream chemistry. Mass balance calculations were performed on average values, but with estimates of uncertainty associated with each input parameter. A Monte Carlo simulation was run (10 000 runs) for Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, N, and S. In the absence of harvesting, average mass balance estimates are positive for all nutrients except S. When harvesting is considered, average mass balances remain positive for all nutrients except Ca, K, and S. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that mass balances for Na are always positive, while mass balances for Mg, K, N, P, and S range from slightly positive to slightly negative. In contrast, mass balance simulations for Ca are always negative and average net losses represent ∼1% of the current exchangeable soil Ca pool.",

		"abstract": "Our understanding of how forest management practices affect the relative importance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous resource use by headwater stream food webs is relatively poor. To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25–75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.",

This study introduces the application of parallel coordinates to ecologists, illustrating the utility of this tool to visualize and explore different types of multivariate data. We demonstrate this tool with two case studies in Canada to (i) explore water-quality associations with benthic macroinvertebrate indicators of stream condition in the St. Lawrence drainage basin, and (ii) identify environmental conditions that contribute to invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) proliferation across inland lakes of Ontario.

		"abstract": "One of the main goals of ecology is to understand how the abiotic environment influences the biotic characteristics of the ecosystem. Various processes at multiple scales interact to affect the physical and chemical environments that are experienced by organisms, which ultimately influence community composition. We aimed to understand the processes that control benthic algae community composition within a watershed. We investigated the impact of both land cover and physiochemical variables on benthic algal community composition. We sampled benthic algae along with multiple habitat and water chemistry parameters within three microhabitats across eight sites along the mainstem of the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma. We used the benthic light availability model to assess the amount of light reaching the bottom of the stream. Additionally, we conducted a GIS analysis of the watershed to determine the land cover affecting each of these sites. Several of the in-stream site-scale variables that were measured (e.g., conductivity, pH and canopy cover) were strongly correlated with both position within the watershed and percent agriculture within the watershed. The physiochemical parameters that were correlated with watershed position and land cover were then used to understand the linkage with algae community composition. Algae genera composition was strongly correlated with both light reaching the bottom of the stream and conductivity. Our results suggest a hierarchy of factors that determine species composition and show the dependence of community composition on differing light regimes.",

		"abstract": "Watershed analyses of nutrient removal in riparian buffers have been limited by the geographic methods used to map buffers and by the statistical models used to test and quantify buffer effects on stream nutrient levels. We combined geographic methods that account for buffer prevalence along flow paths connecting croplands to streams with improved statistical models to test for buffer effects on stream nitrate concentrations from 321 tributary watersheds to the Chesapeake Bay, USA. We developed statistical models that predict stream nitrate concentration from watershed land cover and physiographic province. We used information theoretic methods (AICc) to compare models with and without buffer terms, and we demonstrate that models accounting for riparian buffers better explain stream nitrate concentrations than models using only land cover proportions. We analyzed the buffer model parameters to quantify differences within and among physiographic provinces in the potentials for nitrate loss from croplands and nitrate removal in buffers. On average, buffers in Coastal Plain study watersheds had a higher relative nitrate removal potential (95% of the inputs from cropland) than Piedmont buffers (35% of inputs). Buffers in Appalachian Mountain study watersheds were intermediate (retaining 39% of cropland inputs), but that percentage was uncertain. The absolute potential to reduce nitrate concentration was highest in the Piedmont study watersheds because of higher nitrate inputs from cropland. Model predictions for the study watersheds provided estimates of nitrate removals achieved with the existing cropland and buffer distributions. Compared to expected nitrate concentrations if buffers were removed, current buffers reduced average nitrate concentrations by 0.73 mg N/L (50% of their inputs from cropland) in the Coastal Plain study watersheds, 0.40 mg N/L (11%) in the Piedmont, and 0.08 mg N/L (5%) in the Appalachian Mountains. Restoration to close all buffer gaps downhill from croplands would further reduce nitrate concentrations by 0.66 mg N/L, 0.83 mg N/L, and 0.51 mg N/L, respectively, in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Mountain study watersheds. Aggregate nitrate removal by riparian buffers was less than suggested by many studies of field-to-stream transects, but buffer nitrate removal is significant, and restoration could achieve substantial additional removal.",

		"abstract": "This review evaluates research in the past 20 years focusing on groundwater nitrate removal in the riparian zones of agricultural watersheds. Studies have reported a large range in the magnitude of groundwater and nitrate fluxes to buffers in different hydrogeologic settings. An earlier focus on buffers with shallow subsurface flow has expanded to include sites with deep flow paths and groundwater-fed overland flow. Nitrate removal efficiency and the width required for removal have been linked to riparian sediment texture and depth to an impervious layer. Denitrification has been identified as the dominant mechanism of nitrate removal based on evidence that this process occurs at depth in many buffers which contain buried organic-rich deposits. Several studies have assessed the cumulative effect of riparian buffers on nitrate removal at the watershed scale. Despite considerable research progress areas of uncertainty still remain. Buffers with coarse-textured sediments located in landscapes with upslope sand aquifers have received most attention. In contrast, few sites have been analysed in weathered bedrock and glacial till landscapes. Many studies have reported nitrate removal efficiency based on nitrate concentrations rather than measuring groundwater fluxes which assess the magnitude of nitrate removal. More information is needed on interactions between riparian hydrological flow paths and biogeochemical processes. Further research is recommended on the effect of riparian zone nitrate removal at the watershed scale and long-term monitoring with respect to buffer restoration, the ability to sustain nitrate removal and responses to land use and climate change.",

		"abstract": "Paired watershed studies have limited researchers wishing to disentangle road and harvesting effects on peak flows or to study management schemes other than the existing scenario. The outcomes of many paired watershed studies examining peak flows have also recently been challenged since only an approach that pairs peak flows by frequency can adequately evaluate the effects of harvesting on peak flows. This study takes advantage of a model that has been developed and extensively tested at a site containing a rich set of internal catchment process observations to examine the isolated and combined effects of roads and harvesting on the peak flow regime of a snow-dominated catchment for return periods of up to 100 years. Contrary to the prevailing perception in forest hydrology, the effects of harvesting are found to increase with return period, which is attributable to the uniqueness of peak flow runoff generation processes in snow-dominated catchments. Planned harvesting (50% harvest area) is found to have a significant effect (9%–25% over control) on peak flows with recurrence intervals ranging 10–100 years. Peak flow frequency increases after harvesting increase with return period, with the largest events (100 year) becoming 5–6.7 times more frequent, and medium-sized events (10 year) becoming 1.7–2 times more frequent. Such changes may have substantial ecological, hydrological, and geomorphological consequences within the watershed and farther downstream. Study findings suggest that peak flow regimes are fairly tolerant to the current level of harvesting in this particular watershed but that further harvesting may affect this element significantly.",

		"abstract": "This chapter reviews how global change affects forest-water interactions and water availability to ecosystems and people and synthesises current understanding of the implications of present and anticipated changes to forests and tree cover for local and global hydrology. Forest cover has declined in the past half-century, despite an increase in plantation forestry. Natural and human disturbances affect forest components (e.g. canopy and leaf area, litter and soil surface, rooting depth, and soil porosity) that in turn affect hydrological processes (e.g. interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, soil moisture storage, and percolation). Many of these changes result from several influential natural disturbance processes including insects and pathogens, wildfire, ice storms, and windthrow, and human disturbances including establishment and harvest of forests, plantations, agroforestry areas, and urban/peri-urban forests. However, each disturbance process affects different components of the forest, producing distinctive hydrologic effects. Climate change will directly alter forest hydrological processes, and social and economic factors will directly alter forest management, via intensive plantations, deforestation, forest degradation, selective logging, loss of riparian forest, and loss of urban trees, and changes in disturbance regimes. Despite extensive knowledge of forest hydrology, forest changes and their effects on hydrology are poorly documented in many areas of the world, and novel combinations of processes and contexts may produce surprising outcomes. Thus, there is a clear need for more geographically extensive and long-term place-based studies of forest and water. In summary, future climate and social changes will alter forests and water, requiring continued research and collaboration with forest managers and forest owners both for improved resilience to such changes, and to better realize multiple benefits.",

Adverse effects on stream water quality and aquatic ecosystems following ground-based harvesting operations that open forest canopies and compact soils have spurred the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) that are intended to limit runoff volumes (i.e., water yield increase, WYI) and total sediment yields (TSY) into streams. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent insights from water and sediment yield studies, ranging in scale from hillslope plots to catchments, that reveal the sources and mechanisms of hydrological impairment and recovery, and point to specific strategies for developing more targeted BMPs that help prevent, mitigate, and rehabilitate forested watersheds.",

		"abstract": "Forest harvesting often increases catchment quickflow (QF, water delivered rapidly to the stream channel), a metric of high-flow events controlling a catchment's solute and sediment export. Nevertheless, our understanding of QF responses to various silvicultural strategies (e.g., clearcutting, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) is incomplete. We present a 31-year examination of QF delivery from treatment (clearcut, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) and control catchments in a deciduous forest landscape in central Ontario, Canada. Growing season root-zone storage capacity was estimated using a water balance approach to evaluate temporal changes in QF response to precipitation (P) for pretreatment and posttreatment periods. Threshold relationships between QF and P were assessed for control and treatment catchments for pretreatment and posttreatment periods using piecewise regression. Root-zone storage capacity demarcated shifts in the hydrologic regime arising from forest harvesting and subsequent regeneration. This was particularly pronounced for clearcutting where postharvest decline in root-zone storage capacity was followed by a rise to preharvest values. Similar pretreatment threshold relationships between QF and P, and near-identical P thresholds for producing significant QF, reflected similar soil and overburden depths in the catchments. Harvesting effects were indicated by increases in QF/P ratios for relative small P and the number of P events that generated QF, thus changing treatment QF vs. P threshold relationships. Prior to harvesting there was no significant increase in QF with P below a threshold P of 35–45 mm; however, there was a significant QF vs. P relationship below this threshold for all treatments postharvest. Clearcutting increased the number of QF events for the entire postharvest period and the first 9-year postharvest compared to the other treatments; nevertheless, evidence for intertreatment differences in total QF depth delivered from the catchments during the growing season was inconclusive. Our work suggests that changes in threshold relationships between QF and P, coupled with knowledge of the physical processes underlying them, are useful when evaluating hydrologic responses to forest harvesting.",

		"abstract": "Multicollinearity represents a high degree of linear intercorrelation between explanatory variables in a multiple regression model and leads to incorrect results of regression analyses. Diagnostic tools of multicollinearity include the variance inflation factor (VIF), condition index and condition number, and variance decomposition proportion (VDP). The multicollinearity can be expressed by the coefficient of determination \n(Rh2) of a multiple regression model with one explanatory variable (Xh) as the model’s response variable and the others (Xi [i≠h] as its explanatory variables. The variance \n(σh2) of the regression coefficients constituting the final regression model are proportional to the VIF (11-Rh2). Hence, an increase in Rh2 (strong multicollinearity) increases σh2. The larger σh2 produces unreliable probability values and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. The square root of the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to each eigenvalue from the correlation matrix of standardized explanatory variables is referred to as the condition index. The condition number is the maximum condition index. Multicollinearity is present when the VIF is higher than 5 to 10 or the condition indices are higher than 10 to 30. However, they cannot indicate multicollinear explanatory variables. VDPs obtained from the eigenvectors can identify the multicollinear variables by showing the extent of the inflation of σh2 according to each condition index. When two or more VDPs, which correspond to a common condition index higher than 10 to 30, are higher than 0.8 to 0.9, their associated explanatory variables are multicollinear. Excluding multicollinear explanatory variables leads to statistically stable multiple regression models.",

Here we identify limitations restricting the development of multiple-stressor management strategies and address these, bridging theory and practice, within a novel empirical framework. Those critical limitations include that (i) monitoring schemes fall short of accounting for theory on relationships between multiple-stressor interactions and ecological responses, (ii) current empirical modelling approaches neglect the prevalence and intensity of multiple-stressor interactions, and (iii) mechanisms of stressor interactions are often poorly understood. We offer practical recommendations for the use of empirical models and experiments to predict the effects of freshwater degradation in response to changes in multiple stressors, demonstrating this approach in a case study. Drawing on our framework, we offer practical recommendations to support the development of effective management strategies in three general multiple-stressor scenarios.",

		"abstract": "To understand ecosystem responses to anthropogenic global change, a prevailing framework is the definition of threshold levels of pressure, above which response magnitudes and their variances increase disproportionately. However, we lack systematic quantitative evidence as to whether empirical data allow definition of such thresholds. Here, we summarize 36 meta-analyses measuring more than 4,600 global change impacts on natural communities. We find that threshold transgressions were rarely detectable, either within or across meta-analyses. Instead, ecological responses were characterized mostly by progressively increasing magnitude and variance when pressure increased. Sensitivity analyses with modelled data revealed that minor variances in the response are sufficient to preclude the detection of thresholds from data, even if they are present. The simulations reinforced our contention that global change biology needs to abandon the general expectation that system properties allow defining thresholds as a way to manage nature under global change. Rather, highly variable responses, even under weak pressures, suggest that ‘safe-operating spaces’ are unlikely to be quantifiable.",

		"abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by a range of stressors arising from diverse human-caused land and water uses. Identifying the relative importance of single stressors and understanding how multiple stressors interact and jointly affect biology is crucial for River Basin Management. This study addressed multiple human-induced stressors and their effects on the aquatic flora and fauna based on data from standard WFD monitoring schemes. For altogether 1095 sites within a mountainous catchment, we used 12 stressor variables covering three different stressor groups: riparian land use, physical habitat quality and nutrient enrichment. Twenty-one biological metrics calculated from taxa lists of three organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes) served as response variables. Stressor and response variables were subjected to Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) analysis to identify stressor hierarchy and stressor interactions and subsequently to Generalised Linear Regression Modelling (GLM) to quantify the stressors standardised effect size. Our results show that riverine habitat degradation was the dominant stressor group for the river fauna, notably the bed physical habitat structure. Overall, the explained variation in benthic invertebrate metrics was higher than it was in fish and macrophyte metrics. In particular, general integrative (aggregate) metrics such as % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa performed better than ecological traits (e.g. % feeding types). Overall, additive stressor effects dominated, while significant and meaningful stressor interactions were generally rare and weak. We concluded that given the type of stressor and ecological response variables addressed in this study, river basin managers do not need to bother much about complex stressor interactions, but can focus on the prevailing stressors according to the hierarchy identified.",

Most studies to date assume that stressors operate in perfect synchrony, but this will rarely be the case in reality. Stressor sequence and overlap will have implications for ecological memory – the ability of past stressors to influence future responses. Moreover, stressors are usually defined in an anthropocentric context: what we consider a short-term stressor, such as a flood, will span multiple generations of microbes. We argue that to predict responses to multiple stressors from individuals to the whole ecosystem, it is necessary to consider metabolic rates, which determine the timescales at which individuals operate and therefore, ultimately, the ecological memory at different levels of ecological organization.",

We figured out essential features that describe temporal dynamics by finding similarities among about 60 ecological concepts and theories. We found that considering the hierarchically nested structure of complexity in temporal patterns (i.e. hierarchical complexity) can well describe the fundamental nature of temporal dynamics by expressing which patterns are observed at each scale. Across all ecological levels, driver–response relationships can be temporally variant and dependent on both short- and long-term past conditions.

		"abstract": "Freshwaters are critical to human survival and well-being. However, over-reliance on freshwaters has made them among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Freshwaters also connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems, making them a melting pot for anthropogenic stressors, in-particular agricultural and urban runoff containing chemical and nutrient pollution. Many of the ecosystem services provided by freshwaters are directly or indirectly supported by microorganisms, which form the basal layer of aquatic food webs, drive nitrogen fixation, oxygen production, and nutrients cycling. Yet the effects of multiple interacting stressors on microbial populations and communities is poorly understood and rarely considered in policy development. Here, we evaluate the current state of knowledge around how key anthropogenic stressors, pesticide and antibiotic pollution, affect freshwater microbiomes. Based on their concentrations in EU rivers and prevalence in agriculture, we review freshwater microbial community responses to eight selected chemicals pollutants: glyphosate, diflufenican, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, metaldehyde, imidacloprid, tebuconazole, and chlorothalonil. We focused on mesocosm-based studies as these balance environmental realism and experimental control, providing mechanistic insights into ecological effects. Our review revealed a systematic bias towards a limited selection of chemicals, studied in isolation, on a subset of microbial taxa. For example, studies focussing on glyphosate represent approximately ⅓ of all the relevant publications identified, while other prevalent chemical pollutants such as metaldehyde, chlorothalonil, and diflufenican are ignored. More research is urgently needed to fill this gap, especially studies investigating the interacting effects of chemical mixtures with other anthropogenic stressors, for example nutrient pollution and climate change. We propose a move away from the over-simplistic study of chemical pollutants towards a research agenda that incorporates more realistic scenarios and comprehensive biomonitoring combining taxonomic and trait-based information.",

		"abstract": "As most ecosystems are being challenged by multiple, co-occurring stressors, an important challenge is to understand and predict how stressors interact to affect biological responses. A popular approach is to design factorial experiments that measure biological responses to pairs of stressors and compare the observed response to a null model expectation. Unfortunately, we believe experiment sample sizes are inadequate to detect most non-null stressor interaction responses, greatly hindering progress. Using both real and simulated data, we show sample sizes typical of many experiments (<6) can (i) only detect very large deviations from the additive null model, implying many important non-null stressor-pair interactions are being missed, and (ii) potentially lead to mostly statistical outliers being reported. Computer code that simulates data under either additive or multiplicative null models is provided to estimate statistical power for user-defined responses and sample sizes, and we recommend this is used to aid experimental design and interpretation of results. We suspect that most experiments may require 20 or more replicates per treatment to have adequate power to detect nonadditive. However, estimates of power need to be made while considering the smallest interaction of interest, i.e., the lower limit for a biologically important interaction, which is likely to be system-specific, meaning a general guide is unavailable. We discuss ways in which the smallest interaction of interest can be chosen, and how sample sizes can be increased. Our main analyses relate to the additive null model, but we show similar problems occur for the multiplicative null model, and we encourage similar investigations into the statistical power of other null models and inference methods. Without knowledge of the detection abilities of the statistical tools at hand or the definition of the smallest meaningful interaction, we will undoubtedly continue to miss important ecosystem stressor interactions.",

		"abstract": "The current review summarizes the knowledge generated by the recently published studies of the last twenty years, in the field of forest road networks, concerning the impact of forest road construction on hydrological processes. The currently applied methodology techniques/practices are discussed, the findings are highlighted and effective mitigation measures to mitigate the impact of forest roads are proposed. Critical for the minimization of the impact of forest roads on overland flow is the significant decrease in road surface runoff and overland flow velocity. The decrease in runoff energy reduces the detachment of soil particles and transportation in streams. The disturbances of forest roads in logging areas should be limited to decrease soil erosion. Additionally, aiming to minimize sediment transportation into the streams, it is very important to reduce the connectivity between the forest roads (or skid trails) and streams. The positive role of vegetation and organic matter on the road prism, naturally/technically established riparian buffers along the streams, and the use of appropriate bioengineering designs for each area significantly decrease the runoff generation and sedimentation. From a construction point of view, the decrease in short and long-term forest road-related impact could be achieved by reducing the depth of excavations and the use of soil compaction limiting technology during forest works. The road network design should be more efficient, avoiding hydrologically active zero-order basins. Techniques that minimize the length and connectivity among skid trails, unpaved roads and streams are highly crucial. Broad-based dips, immediate revegetation and outsloping of the road base are considered good road construction practices. Research should be focused on the hydrologic behavior of forest road networks and on the impact at the watershed scale, the degree of connectivity, utilizing plenty of qualitative field data, especially during intense rainfall events, which has been proven to exacerbate the runoff and sediment generation and transportation into the stream networks.",

		"abstract": "Headwaters (stream orders 1–2) traditionally have been considered depauperate compared to mid-order streams (orders 3–4)—a conclusion that arises from a perception of streams as linear systems and emphasizes change in average α (local) diversity along streams. We hypothesized an opposite pattern for β (among-site) diversity and suggest that headwaters might account for a large degree of basin-scale biodiversity if considered within the more realistic framework of streams as branching networks. We assembled pre-existing biodiversity data from across the globe to test this hypothesis broadly at the population-genetic (mitochondrial haplotype diversity within species) and community (species/taxonomic diversity) levels, with a focus on macroinvertebrates. We standardized 18 (9 headwater and 9 mid-order) population-genetic and 16 (10 headwater and 6 mid-order) community-level ecoregional data sets from 5 global ecozones for robust comparisons of β-diversity estimates between the 2 stream-size categories. At the population-genetic level, we applied measures of among-site variation commonly used at both population-genetic (FST and ΦST) and community (Sørensen’s dissimilarity with both presence/absence and abundance data) levels and developed a novel strategy to compare expected rates of loss of γ (regional) diversity as individual sites are eliminated sequentially from regions. At the community level, we limited analyses to Sørensen’s presence/absence measures. We found that Sørensen’s dissimilarity was significantly greater among headwaters than among mid-order streams at both population-genetic and community levels. We also showed that individual headwater reaches accounted for greater proportions of genetic γ diversity than did mid-order reaches. However, neither FST nor ΦST was significantly different between stream-size categories. These measures, which have been used traditionally for comparisons of population-genetic variation, measure proportions of total variation rather than solely among-site variation (i.e., they also are influenced by within-site variation). In contrast, Sørensen’s dissimilarity measures only among-site variation and, therefore, is presumably more useful for reflecting general β diversity. Overall results suggest that, on average, headwaters probably contribute disproportionately to biodiversity at the network scale. This finding demands a shift in thinking about the biodiversity contributions of small headwaters and has strong conservation implications for imperiled headwater streams around the world.",

		"abstract": "Although a number of studies have indicated that microbes are key players in nutrient cycling, limitations on how to accurately assess their diversity have constrained further knowledge on the role of microbial diversity in organic matter decomposition in streams. Microbial diversity on leaf litter of Alnus glutinosa was assessed by microscopic analysis of bacterial cells and released fungal conidia, and by the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using two different primer pairs targeting the rDNA of fungi (ITS2 and 5′ end of the 18S region) and bacteria (V3 region and V6–V8 regions). Fingerprints of fungal and bacterial DNA showed a higher diverse microbial community on decomposing leaves than that assessed by microscopy-based techniques. Higher number of OTUs was obtained with primers targeting the ITS2 region of fungi, but the selected primers for bacteria showed similar number of OTUs. A succession of fungal or bacterial taxa throughout leaf decomposition was found, regardless of the chosen primer. These microbial communities ensured a rapid decomposition of submerged leaf litter (k=−0.045day−1). Fungal biomass (up to 58mgg−1 AFDM) contributed with more than 98% to the total microbial biomass, supporting a greater role of fungi than bacteria in leaf-litter decomposition in streams.",

However, there have been few studies and little direct evidence that leaf-litter microbial communities are affected by disturbance-induced watershed condition, particularly in boreal streams. To test this linkage, we compare the associations of stream physical–chemical characteristics with landscape features (e.g., percent wetlands, roads, riparian woody stem diversity), and leaf-litter microbial activity and structure in streams across varying disturbance-induced watershed conditions. Our findings suggest that the increased stream water conductivity associated with roads can have a negative impact on leaf-litter microbial extracellular enzyme activity associated with a decrease in the abundance of Betaproteobacteria. Wetlands and forests in contrast are important providers of dissolved organic carbon that stimulates the microbial, and in particular fungal, cycling of energy and nutrients. We present a novel and in-depth perspective of leaf-litter microbial communities as a critical link to our understanding and management of the influences of watershed condition on aquatic ecosystems.",

Community-based monitoring projects have been proven successful for the collection of meaningful biological data from a range of target species and ecosystems. The STREAM (Sequencing the Rivers for Environmental Assessment and Monitoring) project combines community-based monitoring with a DNA metabarcoding approach to assess aquatic ecosystem health by determining biodiversity of benthic macroinvertebrate species across Canadian watersheds. STREAM consists of outreach and recruitment, training and dissemination of results obtained from sequence data, allowing rapid generation of watershed biodiversity reports (e.g. in 2 months). We emphasise the benefits of partnering with community groups in these DNA biomonitoring efforts, highlighting the value of environmental stewardship and eliminating bottlenecks for scientific data collection. We believe the approach taken in STREAM is not only applicable to Canada, but functions as an ideal model for freshwater monitoring on a global scale.",

We examined the effects of land use on leaf‐litter microbial communities in boreal streams by comparing the structural (i.e. fungal and bacterial biomass and community composition by next generation sequencing) and functional (i.e. decomposition, and extracellular enzyme activities) characteristics of the microbial communities. Streams draining watersheds with histories of fire, logging, industrial‐mining and urban watershed activity were compared to reference streams. The most severely disturbed industrial and industrial‐urban streams had the lowest rates of microbial litter decomposition, greatly decreased fungal biomass and lacked the ubiquitous bacterial genera Pseudomonas, and Amantichitinum. Hydrolase activity was lowered in all streams with a history of disturbance, with potential adverse effects on energy and nutrient cycling. Our findings demonstrate that the microbial cycling of energy and nutrients in the boreal aquatic ecosystem is affected by land‐use disturbance and illustrate the excellent potential of using microbial communities to track the effects of watershed disturbance and restoration efforts on boreal shield aquatic ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Soils are losing increasing amounts of carbon annually to freshwaters as dissolved organic matter (DOM), which, if degraded, can accelerate climate change. DOM is more susceptible to degradation closer to its source and becomes increasingly dominated by the same, difficult-to-degrade compounds as degradation proceeds. However, the processes underlying DOM degradation across environments are poorly understood. Here we found DOM changed similarly along soil-aquatic gradients irrespective of differences in environmental conditions. Using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we tracked DOM along soil depths and hillslope positions in forest headwater catchments and related its composition to soil microbiomes and physical chemistry. Along depths and hillslopes, carbohydrate-like and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like compounds increased in mass, suggestive of microbial reworking of plant material. More than half of the variation in the abundance of these compounds was related to the expression of genes essential for degrading plant-derived carbohydrates. Our results implicate continuous microbial reworking in shifting DOM towards universal compounds in soils. By synthesising data from the land-to-ocean continuum, we suggest these processes can generalise across ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Such general degradation patterns can be leveraged to predict DOM composition and its downstream reactivity along environmental gradients to inform management of soil-to-stream carbon losses.",

DNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrate communities is a potentially transformative biomonitoring technique that can reduce cost and time constraints while providing information-rich, high resolution taxonomic data for the assessment of watershed condition. Here, we assess the utility of DNA metabarcoding to provide aquatic indicator data for evaluation of forested watershed condition across Canadian eastern boreal watersheds, subject to natural variation and low-intensity harvest management. We do this by comparing the similarity of DNA metabarcoding and morphologically derived macroinvertebrate metrics (i.e. richness, % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, % chironomid), and the ability of DNA metabarcoding and morphological metrics to detect key gradients in stream condition linked to forested watershed features. Our results show consistency between methods, where common DNA metabarcoding and morphological macroinvertebrate metrics are positively correlated and indicate the same key gradients in stream condition (i.e. dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and conductivity) linked to watershed size and shifts in forest composition across watersheds. Our study demonstrates the potential usefulness of macroinvertebrate DNA metabarcoding to future application in broad-scale biomonitoring of watershed condition across environmental gradients.",

		"abstract": "The biochemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influences its biogeochemical role in freshwater ecosystems, yet DOM composition measurements are not routinely incorporated into ecological studies. To date, the majority of studies of freshwater ecosystems have relied on bulk analyses of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to obtain information about DOM cycling. The problem with this approach is that the biogeochemical significance of DOM can only partially be elucidated using bulk analyses alone because bulk measures cannot detect most carbon and nitrogen transformations. Advances in fluorescence spectroscopy provide an alternative to traditional approaches for characterizing aquatic DOM, and allow for the rapid and precise characterization of DOM necessary to more comprehensively trace DOM dynamics. It is within this context that we discuss the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to provide a novel approach to tackling a longstanding problem: understanding the dynamics and biogeochemical role of DOM. We highlight the utility of fluorescence characterization of DOM and provide examples of the potential range of applications for incorporating DOM fluorescence into ecological studies in the hope that this rapidly evolving technique will further our understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Streams are important sources of carbon to the atmosphere, though knowing whether they merely outgas terrestrially derived carbon dioxide or mineralize terrestrial inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still a big challenge in ecology. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of riparian groundwater (GW) and in-stream processes on the temporal pattern of stream DOM concentrations and quality in a forested headwater stream, and whether this influence differed between the leaf litter fall (LLF) period and the remaining part of the year (non-LLF). The spectroscopic indexes (fluorescence index, biological index, humification index, and parallel factor analysis components) indicated that DOM had an eminently protein-like character and was most likely originated from microbial sources and recent biological activity in both stream water and riparian GW. However, paired samples of stream water and riparian GW showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations as well as the spectroscopic character of DOM differed between the two compartments throughout the year. A simple mass balance approach indicated that in-stream processes along the reach contributed to reducing DOC and DON fluxes by 50 and 30 %, respectively. Further, in-stream DOC and DON uptakes were unrelated to each other, suggesting that these two compounds underwent different biogeochemical pathways. During the LLF period, stream DOC and DOC : DON ratios were higher than during the non-LLF period, and spectroscopic indexes suggested a major influence of terrestrial vegetation on stream DOM. Our study highlights that stream DOM is not merely a reflection of riparian GW entering the stream and that headwater streams have the capacity to internally produce, transform, and consume DOM.</p>",

		"abstract": "There is now increasing evidence for the importance of microbial regulation of biogeochemical cycling in streams. Resource availability shapes microbial community structure, but less is known about how landscape-mediated availability of nutrients and carbon can control microbial functions in streams. Using comparative metagenomics, we examined the relationship between microbial functional genes and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), nutrients, and suspended microbial communities in 11 streams, divided into three groups based on the predominant land cover category (agriculture, forested, or wetland). Using weighted gene co-occurrence network analysis, we identified clusters of functions related to DOM composition, agricultural land use, and/or wetland and forest land cover. Wetland-dominated streams were characterized by functions related to nitrogen metabolism and processing of aromatic carbon compounds, with strong positive correlations with dissolved organic carbon concentration and DOM aromaticity. Forested streams were characterized by metabolic functions related to monomer uptake and carbohydrates, such as mannose and fructose metabolism. In agricultural streams, microbial functions were correlated with more labile, protein-like DOM, PO4, and NO3, likely reflecting functional adaptation to labile DOM and higher nutrient concentrations. Distinct changes in the functional composition and loss of functional diversity of microorganisms became evident when comparing natural to agricultural catchments. Although all streams showed signs of functional redundancy, loss of species richness per function in agricultural catchments suggests that microbial functions in natural catchments may be more resilient to disturbance. Our results provide new insight into microbial community functions involved in nutrient and carbon biogeochemical cycles and their dependence on specific environmental settings.",

		"abstract": "1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4 The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.",

		"abstract": "The importance of microbial activity to ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems is well established, but microbial diversity has been less frequently addressed. This review and synthesis of 100s of published studies on stream microbial diversity shows that factors known to drive ecosystem processes, such as nutrient availability, hydrology, metal contamination, contrasting land-use and temperature, also cause heterogeneity in bacterial diversity. Temporal heterogeneity in stream bacterial diversity was frequently observed, reflecting the dynamic nature of both stream ecosystems and microbial community composition. However, within-stream spatial differences in stream bacterial diversity were more commonly observed, driven specifically by different organic matter (OM) compartments. Bacterial phyla showed similar patterns in relative abundance with regard to compartment type across different streams. For example, surface water contained the highest relative abundance of Actinobacteria, while epilithon contained the highest relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This suggests that contrasting physical and/or nutritional habitats characterized by different stream OM compartment types may select for certain bacterial lineages. When comparing the prevalence of physicochemical effects on stream bacterial diversity, effects of changing metal concentrations were most, while effects of differences in nutrient concentrations were least frequently observed. This may indicate that although changing nutrient concentrations do tend to affect microbial diversity, other environmental factors are more likely to alter stream microbial diversity and function. The common observation of connections between ecosystem process drivers and microbial diversity suggests that microbial taxonomic turnover could mediate ecosystem-scale responses to changing environmental conditions, including both microbial habitat distribution and physicochemical factors.",

		"abstract": "Hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention. Most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests. Few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers. This study presents results from a 31-year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central Ontario, Canada. A quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed. Clearcutting resulted in increased water year (WY) runoff. This was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons, with greatest relative increases in Summer. Direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting, although annual peak streamflow did not. Largest increases in WY runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment, likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel. Hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15 years after harvesting. Geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near-surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments, with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response. Such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance.",

Pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions to characterize microbial communities along a hydrological continuum in arctic tundra showed a pattern of decreasing diversity downslope, with highest species richness in soil waters and headwater streams, and lowest richness in lake water. In a downstream lake, 58% and 43% of the bacterial and archaeal taxa, respectively, were also detected in diverse upslope communities, including most of the numerically dominant lake taxa. In contrast, only 18% of microbial eukaryotic taxa in the lake were detected upslope. We suggest that patterns of diversity in surface waters are structured by initial inoculation from microbial reservoirs in soils followed by a species-sorting process during downslope dispersal of both common and rare microbial taxa. Our results suggest that, unlike for metazoans, a substantial portion of bacterial and archaeal diversity in surface freshwaters may originate in complex soil environments.",

		"abstract": "Aim Climate change and anthropogenic environmental deterioration strongly affect aquatic microbial communities. Although microbes have irreplaceable roles in various ecosystems, the spatial variation in microbial communities has received less attention in comparison to macro-organisms. Studies aiming to disentangle the effects of local environmental, catchment and climatic variables on microbial communities are also rare. Here, we disentangled the effects of local, catchment, spatial and climatic variables on boreal stream diatom and bacterial communities. Location Western Finland Methods We sampled 21 boreal river basins comprising 105 study sites spanning 520 km in north-south direction and 330 km in east-west direction in western Finland. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrix analysis (PCNM), redundancy analyses (RDA), variation partitioning, boosted regression trees (BRT) and regression analyses to examine variation in community composition and species richness. Results Water chemistry and physical variables had significant effects on the community composition of both microbial groups. Catchment level variables explained a slightly larger amount of variation in diatom community composition than local level variables. Agriculture was the most significant determinant of variation in diatom community composition among catchment level variables and was also related with variation in the richness of both groups. Of spatial and climatic variables, growing degree days (GDD) and spatial variables were the most significant drivers determining diatom community composition. GDD was also positively associated with the richness of diatoms and bacteria. Unique effects of spatial and climate variables accounted for the largest amount of variation in the community composition of both diatoms and bacteria. Main conclusions Our results highlight that aquatic microbial communities can exhibit biogeographical variation at regional scales due to the joint influence of local, catchment and climatic variables, and possibly because of dispersal limitation. Catchment properties, especially agriculture, can be used as a proxy for the effects of landscape alteration on aquatic microbial communities.",

		"abstract": "Organic matter inputs and accumulation were measured in streams of low-order forest watersheds across a gradient of selective harvesting with no protective riparian buffers assigned. Comparisons were made among sites in selection-cut (average 29% basal area removal), shelterwood-cut (average 42% basal area removal), diameter limit-cut (average 89% basal area removal), and undisturbed tolerant hardwood catchments. The diameter limit harvest was an intentionally high-disturbance treatment and is not a normal silvicultural prescription for tolerant hardwoods in Ontario. Time trend analyses were conducted to examine differences among sites over a pre- and postharvest experimental period. Selection-based harvesting at up to 42% basal area removal with no riparian buffers did not significantly alter average over-stream canopy cover, leaf litter and other organic matter inputs, benthic particulate organic matter accumulation, or woody debris abundance. Harvesting impacts on over-stream canopy cover and organic matter inputs appeared to be minimized by natural crown architecture (overlap in crowns of over-stream trees, residual mid-crown canopy) and by careful logging practices including retention of many immediate streamside trees (within a few meters of the stream channel) and avoidance of felling directly into the streams. Dissolved organic matter fluxes increased slightly for 1 year after harvest and were associated with increased water yield. At the diameter limit harvesting intensity (about 89% basal area removal), significant effects on organic matter inputs and accumulation in streams were detected. The results indicate that selective harvesting of hardwood forests at up to about 42% basal area removal can be conducted without causing significant reductions in organic matter inputs and accumulation in headwater streams, even without prescribed streamside buffer strips.",

		"abstract": "Increased anthropogenic activities, especially within the river corridor, have progressively disrupted natural flow regimes and segmented channel–floodplain connectivity. Consequent alterations in flow dynamics have caused geomorphic and hydrological changes in channel morphology and behaviour, decreasing their natural replenishment capacity, thereby causing their degradation. The simultaneous disconnection of the channel from its natural floodplain due to intensive cultivation and surface paving has also reduced possible floodwater outlets or seepage zones, which would have otherwise functioned as storm run-off storage buffers that reduced the flood peak downstream. Such occurrences of flow disruption, especially in low-relief topographic regions buffeted by high intensity monsoonal storms, accentuate flood-like situations, since natural channel capacities to transport excess storm-water are diminished, with this further enhancing ongoing or inducing riverbank erosion. Such events have accounted for much loss of life, livelihood and property worldwide and to mitigate their intensity, river restoration techniques have been promoted. These place greater emphasis on ecological management measures that attempt to restore and rehabilitate the geomorphic and hydrological functionality of the stream to a prior, more pristine state to achieve channel stability and regulate flows. Thus, frameworks based on river corridor management, riparian buffer creation and the River Styles Framework instituted guidelines, aided by geospatial analysis techniques, have yielded significant management strategies for such flood- and erosion-affected degraded channel corridors. This paper presents a recent review of such ecological techniques of flood and channel management, especially in monsoonal environments, while highlighting the issues concerning their implementation in developing nations.",

		"abstract": "Climate change can directly affect forest hydrology by altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation, or indirectly by changing disturbance regimes and forest structures at multiple scales. Climate change impacts on the forest-water nexus across biomes are pervasive characterized by a great complexity and uncertainty, significantly impeding the design of adaptive forest watershed management to mitigate climate change risks. This paper reviews our current knowledge on the interactions between climate change and the forest-water nexus at the scales of individual tree, stand, and watershed. We found that climate change dramatically altered watershed hydrology in many parts of the world, with varying hydrological responses at multiple scales of tree species, forest types, climate types, and hydrological regimes. The streamflow response was often more pronounced in snow-dominated or water-limited watersheds, especially in watersheds with increasing droughts due to climate change and intensively managed plantations of either non-native tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Australia) or young coniferous species. Climate change impacts can be compounded or offset by forest changes (i.e., deforestation, and forestation) through forest-climate interactions and feedbacks. Forest management can mitigate or aggravate the negative hydrologic impacts of climate change. Adaptive forest management is a prerequisite for managing the forest-water nexus in the face of climate change. Various forest management strategies aiming at maintaining optimal forest structure and high species diversity are recommended to enhance forest resistance and resilience to climate change and sustain water provision services from forests and other beneficial ecosystem services while minimizing negative impacts and risks of climate change.",

		"abstract": "Forests play a major role in maintaining healthy streams and in providing ecosystem services such as clean drinking water, flood/drought protection and biodiversity, but studies have shown that some forestry operations can compromise these benefits. To assess whether current forest management practices impact stream ecosystems, a five-year study was conducted in J.D. Irving, Limited’s Black Brook Forestry District (New Brunswick, Canada) and in other watersheds with varying forest management intensity. This study was divided into two phases, with each addressing one main research question: 1) how different intensities of forest management affect the ecological health of headwater streams and, 2) whether the changes observed in headwater streams accumulate or dissipate in larger downstream rivers. A comprehensive approach to examining these research questions was taken by measuring multiple abiotic and biotic indicators to assess the integrity of stream ecosystems (sediments, water chemistry, insect communities, leaf decomposition, fish condition, mercury concentrations). The purpose of this paper is: 1) to synthesize the results of numerous scientific articles, and 2) to present the science and management implications in terms that regulatory and industrial forest managers can use to incorporate the lessons learned into their decision making. Results in Phase I show that streams in the most intensively managed catchments had greater inputs of terrestrial materials such as sediments, and these were incorporated into food webs, resulting in more terrestrial diets of aquatic consumers. The important stream function of leaf litter breakdown was negatively influenced by increased management intensity. Management practices related to roads warrant special attention, as roads tended to be more related to changes in stream indicators than tree removal. Additionally, results suggest that wet riparian areas were more sensitive to disturbance than drier riparian areas, which has implications for riparian buffer zone configurations. Regarding Phase II, some of the effects of forest management on small streams accumulated in larger downstream rivers (e.g., sediments, use of terrestrial resources by aquatic organisms), while others dissipated (e.g., water temperature, mercury contents). Interestingly, the impacts of forest management on streams were greater in the basin with tree removal but less silviculture than in the basin with more of both, suggesting that greater overall intensity of forest practices does not necessarily translate into greater environmental impacts, for example when considering partial versus clearcut harvesting. Overall, the study suggests that while current best management practices do not eliminate all effects, they do still offer good protection of biological integrity downstream.",

		"abstract": "The rhizosphere soil microbial community under ice exhibits higher diversity and community turnover in the ice-covered stage. The mechanisms by which community assembly processes shape those patterns are poorly understood in high-latitude wetlands. Based on the 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing data, we determined the diversity patterns for the rhizosphere microbial community of two plant species in a seasonally ice-covered wetland, during the ice-covered and ice-free stages. The ecological processes of the community assembly were inferred using the null model at the phylogenetic bins (taxonomic groups divided according to phylogenetic relationships) level. Different effects of ecological processes on rare and abundant microbial sub-communities (defined by the relative abundance of bins) and bins were further analyzed. We found that bacterial and fungal communities had higher alpha and gamma diversity under the ice. During the ice-free stage, the dissimilarity of fungal communities decreased sharply, and the spatial variation disappeared. For the bacterial community, homogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and ecological processes (undominated processes) were the main processes, and they remained relatively stable across all stages. For the fungal community, during the ice-covered stage, dispersal limitation was the dominant process. In contrast, during the ice-free stage, ecological drift processes were more important in the Scirpus rhizosphere, and ecological drift and homogeneous selection processes were more important in the Phragmites rhizosphere. Regarding the different effects of community assembly processes on abundant and rare microbes, abundant microbes were controlled more by homogeneous selection. In contrast, rare microbes were controlled more by ecological drift, dispersal limitation, and heterogeneous selection, especially bacteria. This is potentially caused by the low growth rates or the intermediate niche breadths of rare microbes under the ice. Our findings suggest the high diversity of microbial communities under the ice, which deepens our understanding of various ecological processes of community assembly across stages and reveals the distinct effects of community assembly processes on abundant and rare microbes at the bin level.",

		"abstract": "Nestedness is a widespread pattern in mutualistic networks that has high ecological and evolutionary importance due to its role in enhancing species persistence and community stability. Nestedness measures tend to be correlated with fundamental properties of networks, such as size and connectance, and so nestedness values must be normalised to enable fair comparisons between different ecological communities. Current approaches, such as using null-corrected nestedness values and z-scores, suffer from extensive statistical issues. Thus a new approach called NODFc was recently proposed, where nestedness is expressed relative to network size, connectance and the maximum nestedness that could be achieved in a particular network. While this approach is demonstrably effective in overcoming the issues of collinearity with basic network properties, it is computationally intensive to calculate, and current approaches are too slow to be practical for many types of analysis, or for analysing large networks. We developed three highly optimised algorithms, based on greedy, hill climbing and simulated annealing approaches, for calculation of NODFc, spread along a speed-quality continuum. Users thus have the choice between a fast algorithm with a less accurate estimate, a slower algorithm with a more accurate estimate and an intermediate option. We outline the package and its implementation, as well as provide comparative performance benchmarking and two example analyses. We show that maxnodf enables speed increases of hundreds of times faster than existing approaches, with large networks seeing the biggest improvements. For example, for a large network with 3,000 links, computation time was reduced from 50 min using the fastest existing algorithm to 11 s using maxnodf. maxnodf makes correctly normalised nestedness measures feasible for complex analyses of even large networks. Analyses that would previously take weeks to complete can now be finished in hours or even seconds. Given evidence that correctly normalising nestedness values can significantly change the conclusions of ecological studies, we believe this package will usher in necessary widespread use of appropriate comparative nestedness statistics.",

		"abstract": "The complexity and multidimensionality of freshwater processes require multiple metrics to assess their responses to disturbances. However, studies have historically relied on structural attributes, while functional attributes have received much less attention. The relative ease of implementing functional attributes, like leaf decomposition assays, make them an attractive choice to complement structural attributes (e.g. species diversity and community composition). However, the congruence of these disparate attributes is still debatable, as studies have reported results to be strongly context-dependent. The concept of using forest biomass as a source of alternative energy instead of fossil fuel has led to rapid changes in forestry practices. One of these practices involves removal of logging residues that would have otherwise been left on site (logging residue removal, LRR), potentially leaving the landscape prone to high erosion, run-off and sedimentation. This study investigated the decomposition rates of alder leaves in sites affected by LRR compared with conventionally logged (CL) and near-natural, non-harvested sites. Our results revealed CL as having the strongest effects, while LRR had an intermediate response, both in terms of decomposition rates (ktotal, kmicrobial and kshredders) and microbial biomass. These results match those for structural attributes reported previously at the same sites, thus providing multiple lines of evidence for the ecosystem-level impacts of forestry activities. Bacterial biomass on decomposing leaves was consistently several orders of magnitude greater than that of fungi in all study streams and treatments. Most previous research on the relative contributions of shredders, fungi and bacteria to leaf decomposition has focused on fast-flowing riffles and more research is needed to clarify their relative roles in other types of running waters, such as the slow-flowing, strongly allochthonous and humic forest streams studied by here. In conclusion, this study points to further need to revise the current practice of forestry activities in light of its negative impact on biodiversity.",

		"abstract": "Water and forests are inextricably linked. Pressures on forests from population growth and climate change are increasing risks to forests and their aquatic ecosystem services (AES). There is a need to incorporate AES in forest management but there is considerable uncertainty about how to do so. Approaches that manage forest ecosystem services such as fiber, water and carbon sequestration independently ignore the inherent complexities of ecosystem services and their responses to management actions, with the potential for unintended consequences that are difficult to predict. The ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard is a standardized framework to assess risks to forest AES and to prioritize management strategies to manage risks within tolerable ranges. The framework consists of five steps: establishing the management context, identifying, analyzing, evaluating and treating the risks. Challenges to implementing the framework include the need for novel models and indicators to assess forest change and resilience, quantification of linkages between forest practice and AES, and the need for an integrated systems approach to assess cumulative effects and stressors on forest ecosystems and AES. In the face of recent international agreements to protect forests, there are emerging opportunities for international leadership to address these challenges in order to protect both forests and AES.",

Regression equations for some physical properties of the stream water were developed between control (W-I) and treatment (W-II) watersheds for calibration (with their 95% confidence limits) and treatment periods. The study discovered significant linear regressions between control and treatment watersheds for color, turbidity, air and water temperatures, suspended sediment concentration, pH and electrical conductivity in the calibration period but not turbidity and suspended sediment concentration in the treatment period. The impact of the timber removal was calculated as the difference between measured and predicted values derived from calibration equations.

		"abstract": "Forest harvest has multiple impacts on adjoining freshwater ecosystems, particularly headwater streams which typically receive minimal protection against forestry. However, evidence on the effectiveness of differently sized riparian buffers remains limited. Using data from two discrete regions of Finland, we assessed the effectiveness of riparian buffers in providing protection for the riparian and stream environment, benthic invertebrate diversity and species composition, and ecosystem functioning of boreal headwater streams. Our study included streams with both wide (>15 m) and narrow (<15 m) riparian buffers, enabling comparison of the two dominant forest certificates (FSC and PEFC). Compared to unharvested reference streams, nutrient concentrations as well as stream and riparian light intensity and temperature were higher at forestry-impacted sites. The amount of woody debris, cover of aquatic mosses and particulate organic matter standing stock were strongly reduced in streams draining harvested forests, especially in narrowly buffered streams. Changes in light and nutrient conditions induced a transition towards more autotrophic conditions. Organic matter decomposition rates were elevated in forestry-impacted sites only in the southern region. Forest harvest decreased macroinvertebrate diversity and evenness, and altered community composition in the northern region, but much weaker changes were observed in the southern region. Our findings support the retention of riparian buffers, but also confirm that their effectiveness depends on the environmental context and thus remains poorly predictable. Our results also suggest that the widely applied PEFC certification does not provide sufficient protection for stream ecosystems and more stringent protocols are needed to ensure ecological sustainability of forestry.",

		"abstract": "We evaluated the effect of timber harvesting on water quality and macroinvertebrate and periphyton assemblages in first-order streams in Maine, USA. Fifteen streams were assigned to one of five treatments: clearcutting without a stream buffer, clearcutting with 11 m buffers, clearcutting with 23 m buffers, partial harvesting with no designated buffer, and unharvested controls. Harvest blocks on both sides of the stream were 6 ha and partial harvesting within buffers was allowed. Specific conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and soluble reactive phosphorus did not change significantly for 3 years after harvesting in all treatments. Unbuffered streams had significantly elevated concentrations of chlorophyll a as well as increased abundance of algal feeding organisms (Diperta Cricotopus and Diptera Psectrocladius). Streams with 11 m buffers had substantial (10-fold) but nonsignificant increases in chlorophyll a. No other significant changes were detected in other treatment groups. In all treatment groups, the dominant taxa (periphyton Achnanthes minutissimum and macroinvertebrate Chironomidae) are adapted to disturbed environments. We attribute the limited harvest-induced changes to lack of soil disturbance within 8 m of the stream, the small (≤40%) proportion of watersheds harvested, and the resilient nature of aquatic organisms. However, small-scale changes may not be detected due to the small sample size, an inherent limitation of field-based studies.",

		"abstract": "National Forests and Water Guidelines require the establishment of riparian buffers to help protect the freshwater environment from disturbance by silvicultural operations on the adjacent land. The main functions of the riparian buffer are considered to be sediment removal and erosion control, protection of water quality, moderation of shade and water temperature, maintenance of habitat structural diversity and ecological integrity, and improvement of landscape quality. This review paper assesses how these functions are affected by the design and management of the riparian forest zone, with a focus on the width of the buffer, the structure of the vegetation and species choice. It is not possible to specify a definitive riparian buffer width that will protect the freshwater environment from every potential threat. Forestry agencies usually recommend widths between 10 and 30 m. Buffer widths towards the lower end of this scale tend to protect the physical and chemical characteristics of a stream, while the maintenance of ecological integrity requires widths at the upper end. In terms of structure and species, the benefits are greatest where the riparian buffer replicates native riparian woodland with an open canopy of mixed species of varied age class. The optimum level of shade is difficult to quantify but limited work suggests that a good balance is achieved where around 50% of the stream surface is open to sunlight and the remainder covered by dappled shade. Within the management of riparian woodland there is a need to consider a streams sensitivity and intrinsic value. Some sites will benefit from active intervention such as thinning, coppicing or pollarding, while others will be favoured by a hands-off approach. Long-term continuity of management is important to ensure that the potential benefits to the freshwater environment are realised.",

		"abstract": "Climate change has altered disturbance regimes in many ecosystems, and predictions show that these trends are likely to continue. The frequency of disturbance events plays a particularly important role in communities by selecting for disturbance-tolerant taxa. However, ecologists have yet to disentangle the influence of disturbance frequency per se and time since last disturbance, because more frequently disturbed systems have also usually been disturbed more recently. Our understanding of the effects of repeated disturbances is therefore confounded by differences in successional processes. We used in-situ stream mesocosms to isolate and examine the effect of disturbance frequency on community composition. We applied substrate moving disturbances at five frequencies, with the last disturbance occurring on the same day across all treatments. Communities were then sampled after a recovery period of 9 days. Macroinvertebrate community composition reflected the gradient of disturbance frequency driven by differential vulnerability of taxa to disturbance. Diversity metrics, including family-level richness, decreased, reflecting a likely loss of functional diversity with increasing disturbance frequency. In contrast, overall abundance was unaffected by disturbance frequency as rapid recovery of the dominant taxon compensated for strong negative responses of disturbance-vulnerable taxa. We show that cumulative effects of repeated disturbances—not just the time communities have had to recover before sampling—alter communities, especially by disproportionately affecting rare taxa. Thus, the timing of past disturbances can have knock-on effects that determine how a system will respond to further change.",

To address this gap in biological- and ecosystem-assessment frameworks, we propose a general metric for evaluating potential legacy effects, which are computed by normalizing altered system function persistence with duration of disturbance. We also propose two distinct legacy-effect categories: signal effects from lags in transport and structural effects from physical landscape changes. Using flux records for water, sediment, nitrogen, and carbon from long-term study sites in the eastern United States from 1500 to 2000, we identify gaps in our understanding of legacy effects and reveal that changes in basin sediment dynamics precede instrumented records. These sediment dynamics are not generally incorporated into interpretations of contemporary records, although their potential legacy effects are substantial. The identification of legacy effects may prove to be a fundamental component of landscape management and effective conservation and restoration practice.",

The responses of macroinvertebrate communities in streams in burned catchments were similar in all biogeographic regions, but the magnitude of these responses varied. Fire combined with high seasonal stream flows, flooding, or drought was associated with reduced measures of taxonomic richness and increased abundance, especially of r-strategist taxa. Differences between sites in burned and unburned catchments were consistently stronger in southeastern Australia than in northwestern intermountain USA and northwestern Mediterranean regions. Our observations suggest that the timing and magnitude of postfire flows (snowmelt, seasonal high flows) may substantially alter the recolonization process and override fire effects, and that drought may play a strong role in limiting the resilience and resistance of macroinvertebrate communities in streams in catchments that have experienced wildfire.",

		"abstract": "article i nfo The importance of dead wood for biodiversity is widely recognized but strategies for conservation exist only in some regions worldwide. Most strategies combine knowledge from observational and experimental studies but remain preliminary as many facets of the complex relationships are unstudied. In this first global review of 79 experimental studies addressing biodiversity patterns in dead wood, we identify major knowledge gaps and aim to foster collaboration among researchers by providing a map of previous and ongoing experiments. We show that research has focused primarily on temperate and boreal forests, where results have helped in de- veloping evidence-based conservation strategies, whereas comparatively few such efforts have been made in subtropical or tropical zones. Most studies have been limited to early stages of wood decomposition and many diverse and functionally important saproxylic taxa, e.g., fungi, flies and termites, remain under-represented. Our meta-analysis confirms the benefits of dead-wood addition for biodiversity, particularly for saproxylic taxa, but shows that responses of non-saproxylic taxa are heterogeneous. Our analysis indicates that global conservation of organisms associated with dead wood would benefit most by prioritizing research in the tropics and other neglected regions, focusing on advanced stages of wood decomposition and assessing a wider range of taxa. By using existing experimental set-ups to study advanced decay stages and additional taxa, results could be obtained more quickly and with less effort compared to initiating new experiments.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: One of the objectives of forest conservation is the set aside of unharvested areas. However, the fragmentation and lack of connectivity of protected areas make the integration of conservation measures in productive forests essential. Strategies to integrate conservation of saproxylic biodiversity in forest management have been developed, but often considering only specific aspects or remaining preliminary otherwise. As the impact of climate change and anthropogenic stresses increases, the development and the synthesis of this approach is crucial. We reviewed the key literature on forest management for biodiversity conservation, integrating forest science perspective to provide a practical management framework. Our goal is to present a management framework that could contribute to the effective preservation of forest insect biodiversity at the landscape scale, without high economic efforts, and addressing the conflicts that still jeopardize sustainable forest management. The results of our review support the creation of micro-reserves inside productive forests, to support large reserves in landscape conservation strategies. Micro-reserves increase the resilience of forest ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbances, through the development of a heterogeneous structure, maximizing microhabitat availability. Modeling forest management and harvest on local natural disturbance would extend the benefits of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in productive forests. Variable retention harvest systems, applied at the landscape scale, are a feasible and adaptable strategy to preserve and increase biodiversity, safeguarding structural legacies such as senescent trees and deadwood inside the productive matrix. The operational shift, from the stand to the forest landscape, is fundamental to extend the benefits of conservation measures. The Forest Biodiversity Artery, composed by several micro-reserves or ilots de senescence, connected by corridors of habitat trees and deadwood, constitutes a network that would deliver old-growth forests attributes to the productive matrix. This planning instrument would support forest connectivity, and socioeconomic constraints.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   The current requirements to decrease the consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuels have increased the demand of renewable energy sources. In forestry, this situation has intensified harvesting practices resulting in a decreased amount of woody debris left on the clear-cut areas. Impacts of energy wood harvest on wood-decomposing fungi were studied in a large-scale experiment in clear-cut stands in three geographical areas in Finland. A sequence of treatments was expected to form a forestry induced soil disturbance gradient: (1) logging residues left at site, no soil preparation; (2) logging residues left at site, patch mounding; (3) 70% logging residue removal, patch mounding; and (4) complete stump and logging residue removal, patch mounding. Pre-weighed wood discs were incubated on the intact soil cover for four years to estimate decomposition rate and fungal decomposer community. A soil sample was taken underneath each disc to evaluate the direct inoculation potential of the soil. The main results were as follows: (1) The differences between the treatments were not significant, while the geographical factors affected the decomposition rate and the fungal communities of the wood discs. (2) The fungal composition in the wood discs did not reflect the underlying soil fungal community, which indicates that a part of the fungal species inhabiting wood discs originated from airborne surrounding sources. (3) The increase in fungal species diversity was associated to the wood decay process, indicated by parallel increase in the wood decomposition rate and the number of white rot and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus our study indicates that in addition to local environment, landscape-level factors control the decomposer fungal community and its activity in wood.",

Initially, we recovered 7743 beetles when stumps were extracted but still on site (Year 1). All beetles were identified to family level and ground beetles and wood-associated beetles to species level. One year after stumps were extracted, the survey was repeated. In this collection, 2898 individual beetles were recovered. In Year 1, stump-harvesting had a negative impact on beetle abundance and richness. However, 1year after stumps were removed, there were no significant differences in these variables at any site. At the community level, stump-harvesting weakly but significantly, affected carabid composition. Oneyear after stumps were removed, stump-harvesting had no effect on community composition.

		"abstract": "Abstract   To harvest more biofuel from forests, tree stumps are sometimes extracted after clearcutting. Species in different organism groups rely on deadwood, and biofuel extraction reduces their substrate. Our aim was to investigate the potential landscape effects of stump extraction, and compare the effects among trophic levels of deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles. We sampled saproxylic beetle species in clearcut stumps using bark sieving. We did the study in 2013 in 49 clearcuts (1–4years old) in three regions in central Sweden where stump extraction had been performed for six years prior to sampling. We selected landscape buffers with 500m, 1000m, and 2000m radius with different intensities of stump extraction (0–100%). We show for the first time, based on empirical data, that increasing stump extraction can affect deadwood-dependent species at the landscape level. On average, obligate predators were more negatively affected than cambivores and facultative predators. The 34 studied saproxylic beetle species showed varied responses to stump extraction in the surrounding landscape, including stable (no response), negative, or positive responses. Positive responses could be due to a crowding effect, indicating a time-lagged response to habitat loss. Since stump extraction in the study area started just six years prior to sampling, time-lags in population-level responses could be expected. The age of the sampled clearcuts influenced the abundance of eleven species, but other local factors had little effect on abundance.  Our results suggest that if stump extraction is widely introduced, deadwood retention—planned for both spatial and temporal continuity—should be an integrated part of intensified forest management. We suggest monitoring the long-term effects of stump extraction.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Dead wood is an important resource for biodiversity, which has often decreased due to forest management. There is an increasing interest in extracting woody residues on clear-cuts for bioenergy production, which will further decrease dead wood amounts. Empirical studies show that such extraction decreases habitat availability for many species at a local scale, but no analyses have been made on long-term effects on population sizes and species persistence in whole landscapes. We investigated how theoretical species that differ in dispersal range, habitat specialization, and commonness are affected by different levels of wood extraction intensity. We also investigated the effect of extracting only slash (branches and tops) compared to both slash and stumps, and the spatial location of the extraction. This was done by simulations of dead wood development and species’ colonization–extinction dynamics based on metapopulation theory. The simulations were run for 200years in an 11×11km managed forest landscape in Sweden. For all species the predicted population sizes decreased, and for six out of eight species the landscape level extinction risks increased with increasing bioenergy extraction. The negative impacts were larger when including stumps compared to extracting slash only. However, rare species declined more strongly with increasing extraction than the common species. Specialists on coarse sun-exposed wood declined more than generalists when stumps were included in the extraction, while the pattern was the opposite when only extracting slash. The population declines continued for up to 200years before colonizations and extinctions were in equilibrium, and were generally slower for rare compared to common species. Concentrating the extraction to 50% of the landscape had a positive effect on rare and short-dispersing species, which could be assumed to be the most threatened species. Thus, bioenergy extraction is likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity, which are most severe when stumps are extracted at a high intensity throughout the landscape. Even at low levels of stump extraction, species which are already rare and specialized on sun-exposed coarse dead wood may be threatened. Slash extraction has probably less impact, since few species are specialized on fine woody debris. Concentrating the extraction to a subset of forested areas may reduce the negative impact. The apparent direct trade-off between the amount of bioenergy extracted and the remaining amount of dead-wood habitat may require that bioenergy extraction is either limited or further conservation interventions are employed that compensate for anthropogenic habitat loss.",

Within disturbed patches, some negative fragmentation effects have been observed for beetles and lichens, but most studies have found a linear relationship between habitat amount and population size.

		"abstract": "Intensive forest harvesting has increased in Fennoscandia over the last few decades. Similar developments may follow throughout Europe as renewable energy replaces fossil fuels. The international literature suggests that intensive harvesting could increase ecological risks to yield, carbon stores, soil fertility, and biodiversity, but geographically specific knowledge is sparse in many countries, and results do not extend beyond 5–30 years after harvesting. We use Denmark as a case for discussing future directions. Forest history is described, and research on ecological effects and their inclusion in governance is reviewed. Denmark was almost completely deforested by the early 1800s, but centuries of afforestation have resulted in a current forest cover of 14.3%. Research commonly uses stem-only harvesting as a reference against which to compare intensive harvesting impacts, but pristine forests would be a more useful reference for ecological processes and biodiversity. However, pristine forests are almost non-existent in Europe, and non-intervention, self-regulating forests provide an alternative. Governance and positions of non-governmental organizations in Denmark focus more on general forest management impacts and conservation of light-demanding biodiversity associated with historic coppicing and grazing than on intensive harvesting. The energy sector drives the development of new governance to verify forest biomass sustainability, but the national knowledge base for such verification is limited. As part of a larger solution, we suggest establishing a network of non-intervention, self-regulating forests that can serve as a reference for long-term research and monitoring of intensive harvesting impacts. This would support the application of adaptive management strategies, and continuous improvements of best management practice guidelines.

We established a wood decomposition assay to determine mass loss of branches and twigs in two decay classes (1, incipient and 2, intermediate decay stage), and used generalized linear mixed-effects models to evaluate whether fungal diversity and mass loss differed between treatments (managed forests and controls). We found no differences in richness nor in abundance between treatments, and their community composition was similar. However, Botryobasidium vagum, Phanerochaete velutina, and Sistotrema brinkmanii were more abundant in managed forests, and Amyloathelia aspera was more abundant in controls. Branches in the intermediate decay stage showed greater mass loss in managed forests than in controls, but mass loss of the other debris types did not differ between treatments. The volume of coarse woody debris was greater in managed forests than in controls, and had a positive effect on fungal richness. Our results indicate that N. pumilio forest management did not generate evident changes in fungal diversity, or in wood decomposition after 20years of the forest management. However, the higher mass loss of branches in the intermediate decay stage observed in managed forests suggests that there were some factors operating in those forests in the past which may have accelerated decomposition. This highlights the need for studies evaluating changes in canopy cover, microclimate, and fungal community, including potential key species, in the short term and the long term after forest management.",

Wood moisture content was significantly correlated with sapwood decay in younger stumps, whereas ITS-based composition and species richness of the fungal community were the best predictors for mass loss in the older stumps. Co-occurrence analysis showed that, in freshly cut trees and in younger stumps, fungal communities were nonrandomly structured, whereas fungal communities in old stumps could not be separated from a randomly assembled community. These results indicate that the most important factors explaining variation in wood decay rates can change over time and that the strength of competitive interactions between fungi in decaying tree stumps may level off with increased wood decay. Our field analysis further suggests that ascomycetes may have a prominent role in wood decay, but their wood-degrading abilities need to be further tested under controlled conditions. The next challenging step will be to integrate fungal community assembly processes in wood decay models to improve carbon sequestration estimates of forests.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Forest management has caused severe ecological degradation throughout the Globe. One of its most prominent consequences is the drastic change in dead wood profile and consequently in the dead wood dependent biota. Wood-inhabiting fungi are, considering ecosystem functions, the most important species group utilizing dead wood, because they take care of majority of the decaying process. The earlier research focusing on the effects of forest management on wood-inhabiting fungi has strongly focused on large dead wood pieces (i.e. coarse woody debris, CWD), even though it has been shown that a major part of fungal diversity utilizes (also) small dead wood pieces (i.e. [very] fine woody debris, [V]FWD). In this paper, we studied the effects of earlier forest management on the wood-inhabiting fungi occupying all dead wood diameter fractions including the smallest pieces. The study was conducted in boreal pine and spruce dominated forests in Finland. Altogether we surveyed corticioid and polyporoid fungi from 113,269 dead wood pieces in 8 previously managed and 8 natural forests. The composition of fungal community varied between the forest types (pine vs. spruce; managed vs. natural) and according to the diameter of the dead wood substrate. However, the fungal diversity occupying CWD, and some diameter fractions of FWD, was clearly lower in managed than natural spruce dominated forests. Moreover, most of the rare species were detected only in natural forests, especially spruce dominated, and based on the species accumulation curves these sites were also the ones where largest proportion of community remained undetected. The effects of earlier forest management are evident also in fungal communities occupying FWD. The effects are, however, clearly stronger in CWD and especially in spruce dominated forests. Consequently, the main focus in forest conservation and restoration efforts may still be targeted on increasing CWD volume in managed landscapes, but simultaneously attention must be targeted on retaining reasonable volume of FWD to ensure that the species specialized in utilizing it will not be driven to local extinctions. Combining this recommendation with increasing pressure for energy wood harvesting will remain as a challenge.",

Community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi changes with mass loss of wood, but the relationship between substrate quality and decomposers is poorly understood. This limits the extent to which these ecosystem services can be effectively managed. We studied the fungal community and physico-chemical quality (stage of decay, dimensions, density, moisture, C : N ratio, lignin and water or ethanol extractives) of 543 Norway spruce logs in five unmanaged boreal forest sites of southern Finland. Fungi were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of DNA extracted directly from wood samples. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were also recorded. Results showed a fungal community succession with decreasing wood density and C : N ratio, and increasing moisture and lignin content. Fungal diversity peaked in the most decayed substrates. Ascomycetes typically colonized recently fallen wood. Brown-rot fungi preferred the intermediate decay stages. White-rot fungi represented approximately one-fifth of sequenced species in all decay phases excluding the final phase, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi became dominant. Lignin content of logs with white-rot fungi was low, and ECM fungi were associated with substrates containing abundant nitrogen. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were observed for only a small number of species detected with molecular techniques.",

		"abstract": "Increasing attention is being paid to using modern fuelwood as a substitute for fossil energies to reduce CO2 emissions. In this context, forest biomass, particularly harvesting residues (branches), and stumps and associated coarse roots, can be used to supply fuelwood chains. However, collecting harvesting residues can affect soil properties and trees, and these effects are still not fully understood. The main objective of the present study was to compile published data worldwide and to quantify the overall effects of removing harvesting residues on nutrient outputs, chemical and biological soil fertility and tree growth, through a meta-analysis. Our study showed that, compared with conventional stem-only harvest, removing the stem plus the harvesting residues generally increases nutrient outputs thereby leading to reduced amounts of total and available nutrients in soils and soil acidification, particularly when foliage is harvested along with the branches. Losses of available nutrients in soils could also be explained by reduced microbial activity and mineralization fluxes, which in turn, may be affected by changes in organic matter quality and environmental conditions (soil compaction, temperature and moisture). Soil fertility losses were shown to have consequences for the subsequent forest ecosystem: tree growth was reduced by 3–7% in the short or medium term (up to 33 years after harvest) in the most intensive harvests (e.g. when branches are exported with foliage). Combining all the results showed that, overall, whole-tree harvesting has negative impacts on soil properties and trees that may have an impact on the functioning of forest ecosystems. Practical measures that could be taken to mitigate the environmental consequences of removing harvesting residues are discussed.",

Understanding the degradation process is important when considering how products perform, but this knowledge can also be useful when determining how climates affect the organisms involved and the rates at which degradation occurs. Above ground wood decay tends to occur more slowly than decay in direct soil contact and is more dependent on climatic differences and wood species chemistries. While above ground wood deterioration is a subject of interest, most research has concentrated on the effects of the organisms on the wood. There are surprisingly few comprehensive studies of the fungi involved in the process and most have been performed under aggressive tropical conditions. Fungal colonization of red alder and Douglas-fir samples exposed above ground was evaluated over a 24-month period. Red alder is highly susceptible to fungal attack while Douglas-fir is moderately resistant. As such, they presented two differing selective media for fungal colonization. Red alder was more heavily colonized than Douglas-fir, reflecting the differing susceptibility of the two wood species to degradation. A similar number of Ascomycete and Basidiomycete species were isolated (11 vs 8 species, respectively), but Basidiomycetes were more frequently isolated. These results were similar to those found under more tropical conditions. The results illustrate the wide range of species that colonize wood exposed above ground.",

		"abstract": "The carbon flux from woody debris, a crucial uncertainty within global carbon-climate models, is simultaneously affected by climate, site environment and species-based variation in wood quality. In the first global analysis attempting to explicitly tease out the wood quality contribution to decomposition, we found support for our hypothesis that, under a common climate, interspecific differences in wood traits affect woody debris decomposition patterns. A meta-analysis of 36 studies from all forested continents revealed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and C : N ratio correlate with decomposition rates of angiosperms. In addition, gymnosperm wood consistently decomposes slower than angiosperm wood within common sites, a pattern that correlates with clear divergence in wood traits between the two groups. New empirical studies are needed to test whether this difference is due to a direct effect of wood trait variation on decomposer activity or an indirect effect of wood traits on decomposition microsite environment. The wood trait‐decomposition results point to an important role for changes in the wood traits of dominant tree species as a driver of carbon cycling, with likely feedback to atmospheric CO2 particularly where angiosperm species replace gymnosperms regionally. Truly worldwide upscaling of our results will require further site-based multi-species wood trait and decomposition data, particularly from low-latitude ecosystems.",

Since wood decomposition is a decisive process in nutrient recycling, soil formation and the carbon budget of forest ecosystems, it is receiving increasing attention from forest ecologists, pathologists and managers. Research has focussed on the factors driving the species-richness of wood-decomposing organisms and is moving on to analyse the effects of this species-richness on ecosystem functioning. Coarse woody debris (CWD) and its associated wood-decaying organisms have been drastically reduced in abundance and diversity by forestry and so these features often have potential as conservation indicators. Protective measures at a landscape level are needed for threatened wood-inhabiting fungi. These include restricting salvage operations in windthrow stands, actively encouraging the accumulation of deadwood in forests, and facilitating decay in standing trees by inoculating them with fungi.

Based on our analysis of concepts and experiments of leaf decomposition in forest floors and streams, we suggest that changes in species diversity within and across trophic levels can significantly alter decomposition.

However, the difficulty of studying the complex kingdom of fungi under real forest conditions has led to rather scattered scientific knowledge. Here, we provide the current state of knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii) silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods, selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi. The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv) landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained.",

		"abstract": "1. Wood-decaying fungi are ubiquitous and functionally important organisms within forest ecosystems world-wide, but remarkably little is known of their population dynamics in relation to the dynamics of their host substrates. Living in transient environments, where local extinctions are caused by gradual substrate (patch) destruction or deterioration due to wood decomposition, the long-term persistence of these species requires successful colonization of new patches.2. During a 6-year period, we examined the colonization-extinction dynamics of wood-decaying fungi (Aphyllophorales: Polyporaceae and Corticiaceae) in relation to the spatiotemporal distribution of host logs within a boreal old-growth Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest.3. The dynamics of the species studied were strongly influenced by both local log characteristics (within patch) and connectivity (between patch). Several species (e.g. Asterodon ferruginosus, Phellinus ferrugineofuscus, P. viticola, Phlebia centrifuga) showed a positive effect of connectivity, mainly colonizing logs in the vicinity of previously occupied logs. This implies that some wood-decaying fungi may be dispersal limited in terms of successful colonizations. The relative importance of patch conditions and connectivity was however, highly species specific.4. Our results further illustrate the importance of life-strategies adopted by species that are present during different stages of wood decomposition. Early colonizers were primarily affected by the stage of decomposition; secondary colonizers were affected by a variety of within patch and/or between patch variables, maintaining high species coexistence within intermediate stages of decay. Phellinus nigrolimitatus was the dominant polyporous decayer at the final stages of decomposition, clearly gaining a competitive advantage from specializing on highly decomposed wood and having very low mean annual mortality rates.5. Local extinction rates were higher on small diameter logs than large diameter logs, and generally increased as decay proceeded, illustrating the importance of deterministic patch destruction due to wood decomposition.6. Synthesis. The fungi-log study system was highly dynamic, illustrating that both characteristics and spatiotemporal availability of logs are important in explaining the distribution patterns and population dynamics of wood-decaying fungal communities. The result implies that the dynamics of some wood-decaying fungi can be characterized as patch-tracking metapopulations, with connectivity-dependent colonizations and local extinctions caused by the turnover of the patches.",

		"abstract": "Community assembly history is increasingly recognized as a fundamental determinant of community structure. However, little is known as to how assembly history may affect ecosystem functioning via its effect on community structure. Using wood-decaying fungi as a model system, we provide experimental evidence that large differences in ecosystem functioning can be caused by small differences in species immigration history during community assembly. Direct manipulation of early immigration history resulted in threefold differences in fungal species richness and composition and, as a consequence, differences of the same magnitude in the rate of decomposition and carbon release from wood. These effects – which were attributable to the history-dependent outcome of competitive and facilitative interactions – were significant across a range of nitrogen availabilities observed in natural forests. Our results highlight the importance of considering assembly history in explaining ecosystem functioning.",

We investigated the relative importance of coarse (diameter >10 cm) and fine woody debris (1–10 cm) for fungi in broadleaf forests in southern Sweden. The numbers of species per unit wood volume and per forest area were significantly higher for fine than for coarse woody debris for both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. When the number of species was plotted against the number of records, coarse woody debris was more species rich than fine woody debris for a given number of basidiomycete records. Of the ascomycetes, 75% were found exclusively on fine woody debris (the corresponding proportion for basidiomycetes is 30%), 2% were found exclusively on coarse woody debris (basidiomycetes 26%), and 23% of the species were found on both diameter classes (basidiomycetes 44%). We conclude that fine woody debris is important for diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi, especially ascomycetes, in this forest type. However, coarse woody debris must also be provided to insure the occurrence of many species of basidiomycetes.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   The species composition of wood-inhabiting fungi (polypores and corticoids) was investigated on 1138 spruce logs and 992 pine logs in 90 managed and 34 natural or near-natural spruce and pine forests in SE Norway.  Altogether, the study included 290 species of wood-inhabiting fungi. Comparisons of logs with similar properties (standardized tree species, decay class, dimension class) in natural and managed forests showed a significant reduction in species number per log in managed spruce forests, but not in managed pine forests. The species number per log in managed spruce forests was 10–55% lower than on logs from natural spruce forests. The reduction was strongest on logs of large dimensions. A comparison of 200–400 spruce logs from natural and managed forests showed a 25% reduction in species richness corresponding to a conservative loss of ca. 40 species on a regional scale.  A closer inspection revealed that species confined to medium and very decayed spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests, whereas species on early decay classes and decay generalists were unaffected. Similarly, species preferring large spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests. Forest management had strongest impact on low-frequent species in the spruce forests (more than 50% reduction), whereas common species were modestly affected. Corticoid fungi were more adversely affected than polypore fungi.  These results indicate that wood-decaying fungi in pine forests are more adapted to forest disturbances than spruce-associated species. Management measures securing a continuous supply of dead wood are more important in spruce forests than in pine forests.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Because biased biodiversity surveys may result in ineffective use of conservation or research resources it is important that measures for biodiversity are accurate. In forest ecosystems wood-inhabiting fungi are an ecologically important species group. We addressed the question whether or not the traditional methodology to survey only coarse woody debris provides accurate estimates of the assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi or the dead wood itself. In this study, we included all dead wood pieces irrespective of the diameter. Our results showed that the chosen minimum size of studied dead wood pieces has crucial importance for species recordings of wood-inhabiting fungi and for recording the number of dead wood items in boreal forests. Setting the lower limit of surveyed dead wood to 1cm resulted in the loss of 96% of the dead wood pieces from the data. Excluding the smallest dead wood resulted in underestimation of the species richness by 10% and occurrences by 46%. By setting the lower limit at 5cm, 24% of species and 66% of occurrences would have been lost from the data, including many species considered to be rare. Ordination analysis also showed that the species assembly in the smallest dead wood pieces is distinctive. We conclude that surveying only coarse woody debris may seriously underestimate dead wood amounts as well as species richness and abundance of dead-wood-associated biota.",

		"abstract": "We used species-specific spore traps to measure airborne dispersal of the wood decay fungus Phlebia centrifuga (spore size 6.5–9 × 2.5–3 μm) up to 1000 m distance from a point source. We fitted two simple dispersal models, an empirical power law model and a semi-mechanistic diffusion model to the data using the Bayesian approach. The diffusion model provided a better fit than the power law model which underestimated deposition at 3–55 m and overestimated deposition at longer and shorter distances. Model fit improved by allowing overdispersion, suggesting that spores are not dispersed independently but wind can transport spores in groups inside discrete air packages up to considerable distances. Using the fitted diffusion model and available information on the establishment rates of wood-decay fungi, we examine the distance up to which colonisation from a single fruit body is likely to occur. We conclude that the diluting effect of distance and low establishment success make the occurrence of P. centrifuga dispersal limited possibly already at the distance of tens of metres and very probably at a few hundred metres from the nearest fruit body, despite the fact that under favourable conditions a high proportion of the spores can disperse considerably further. This conclusion is likely to hold generally for those fungal species that inhabit fragmented landscapes, have specialised resource and habitat requirements, and have similar spore size and other dispersal traits as P. centrifuga.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention. Most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests. Few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers. This study presents results from a 31-year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central Ontario, Canada. A quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed. Clearcutting resulted in increased water year (WY) runoff. This was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons, with greatest relative increases in Summer. Direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting, although annual peak streamflow did not. Largest increases in WY runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment, likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel. Hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15years after harvesting. Geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near-surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments, with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response. Such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance.",

		"abstract": "Forest harvesting often increases catchment quickflow (QF, water delivered rapidly to the stream channel), a metric of high‐flow events controlling a catchment's solute and sediment export. Nevertheless, our understanding of QF responses to various silvicultural strategies (e.g., clearcutting, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) is incomplete. We present a 31‐year examination of QF delivery from treatment (clearcut, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) and control catchments in a deciduous forest landscape in central Ontario, Canada. Growing season root‐zone storage capacity was estimated using a water balance approach to evaluate temporal changes in QF response to precipitation (P) for pretreatment and posttreatment periods. Threshold relationships between QF and P were assessed for control and treatment catchments for pretreatment and posttreatment periods using piecewise regression. Root‐zone storage capacity demarcated shifts in the hydrologic regime arising from forest harvesting and subsequent regeneration. This was particularly pronounced for clearcutting where postharvest decline in root‐zone storage capacity was followed by a rise to preharvest values. Similar pretreatment threshold relationships between QF and P, and near‐identical P thresholds for producing significant QF, reflected similar soil and overburden depths in the catchments. Harvesting effects were indicated by increases in QF/P ratios for relative small P and the number of P events that generated QF, thus changing treatment QF vs. P threshold relationships. Prior to harvesting there was no significant increase in QF with P below a threshold P of 35–45 mm; however, there was a significant QF vs. P relationship below this threshold for all treatments postharvest. Clearcutting increased the number of QF events for the entire postharvest period and the first 9‐year postharvest compared to the other treatments; nevertheless, evidence for intertreatment differences in total QF depth delivered from the catchments during the growing season was inconclusive. Our work suggests that changes in threshold relationships between QF and P, coupled with knowledge of the physical processes underlying them, are useful when evaluating hydrologic responses to forest harvesting.",

Streams draining watersheds with histories of fire, logging, industrial-mining and urban watershed activity were compared to reference streams.\nThe most severely disturbed industrial and industrial-urban streams had the lowest rates of microbial litter decomposition, greatly decreased fungal biomass and lacked the ubiquitous bacterial genera Pseudomonas, and Amantichitinum. Hydrolase activity was lowered in all streams with a history of disturbance, with potential adverse effects on energy and nutrient cycling.\nOur findings demonstrate that the microbial cycling of energy and nutrients in the boreal aquatic ecosystem is affected by land-use disturbance and illustrate the excellent potential of using microbial communities to track the effects of watershed disturbance and restoration efforts on boreal shield aquatic ecosystems.",

		"abstract": "Microbes are transported in hydrological networks through many environments, but the nature and dynamics of underlying microbial metacommunities and the impact of downslope inoculation on patterns of microbial diversity across landscapes are unknown. Pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions to characterize microbial communities along a hydrological continuum in arctic tundra showed a pattern of decreasing diversity downslope, with highest species richness in soil waters and headwater streams, and lowest richness in lake water. In a downstream lake, 58% and 43% of the bacterial and archaeal taxa, respectively, were also detected in diverse upslope communities, including most of the numerically dominant lake taxa. In contrast, only 18% of microbial eukaryotic taxa in the lake were detected upslope. We suggest that patterns of diversity in surface waters are structured by initial inoculation from microbial reservoirs in soils followed by a species-sorting process during downslope dispersal of both common and rare microbial taxa. Our results suggest that, unlike for metazoans, a substantial portion of bacterial and archaeal diversity in surface freshwaters may originate in complex soil environments.",

		"abstract": "Streams are important sources of carbon to the atmosphere, though knowing whether they merely outgas terrestrially derived carbon dioxide or mineralize terrestrial inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still a big challenge in ecology. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of riparian groundwater (GW) and in-stream processes on the temporal pattern of stream DOM concentrations and quality in a forested headwater stream, and whether this influence differed between the leaf litter fall (LLF) period and the remaining part of the year (non-LLF). The spectroscopic indexes (fluorescence index, biological index, humification index, and parallel factor analysis components) indicated that DOM had an eminently protein-like character and was most likely originated from microbial sources and recent biological activity in both stream water and riparian GW. However, paired samples of stream water and riparian GW showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations as well as the spectroscopic character of DOM differed between the two compartments throughout the year. A simple mass balance approach indicated that in-stream processes along the reach contributed to reducing DOC and DON fluxes by 50 and 30%, respectively. Further, in-stream DOC and DON uptakes were unrelated to each other, suggesting that these two compounds underwent different biogeochemical pathways. During the LLF period, stream DOC and DOC:DON ratios were higher than during the non-LLF period, and spectroscopic indexes suggested a major influence of terrestrial vegetation on stream DOM. Our study highlights that stream DOM is not merely a reflection of riparian GW entering the stream and that headwater streams have the capacity to internally produce, transform, and consume DOM.",

		"abstract": "Summary\n\n\n1\nTimber harvesting exemplifies many aspects of experimental manipulation in applied ecology. Evaluation of the research approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address large-scale and human impacts on the environment.\n\n2\nWe measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002.\n\n3\nThe dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before–after, control–impact) or long-term data sets.\n\n4\nStatistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference).\n\n5\nLack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue.\n\n6\nSynthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.",

		"abstract": "As most ecosystems are being challenged by multiple, co-occurring stressors, an important challenge is to understand and predict how stressors interact to affect biological responses. A popular approach is to design factorial experiments that measure biological responses to pairs of stressors and compare the observed response to a null model expectation. Unfortunately, we believe experiment sample sizes are inadequate to detect most non-null stressor interaction responses, greatly hindering progress. Using both real and simulated data, we show sample sizes typical of many experiments (<6) can (i) only detect very large deviations from the additive null model, implying many important non-null stressor-pair interactions are being missed, and (ii) potentially lead to mostly statistical outliers being reported. Computer code that simulates data under either additive or multiplicative null models is provided to estimate statistical power for user-defined responses and sample sizes, and we recommend this is used to aid experimental design and interpretation of results. We suspect that most experiments may require 20 or more replicates per treatment to have adequate power to detect nonadditive. However, estimates of power need to be made while considering the smallest interaction of interest, i.e., the lower limit for a biologically important interaction, which is likely to be system-specific, meaning a general guide is unavailable. We discuss ways in which the smallest interaction of interest can be chosen, and how sample sizes can be increased. Our main analyses relate to the additive null model, but we show similar problems occur for the multiplicative null model, and we encourage similar investigations into the statistical power of other null models and inference methods. Without knowledge of the detection abilities of the statistical tools at hand or the definition of the smallest meaningful interaction, we will undoubtedly continue to miss important ecosystem stressor interactions.",

To address this gap in biological- and ecosystem-assessment frameworks, we propose a general metric for evaluating potential legacy effects, which are computed by normalizing altered system function persistence with duration of disturbance. We also propose two distinct legacy-effect categories: signal effects from lags in transport and structural effects from physical landscape changes. Using flux records for water, sediment, nitrogen, and carbon from long-term study sites in the eastern United States from 1500 to 2000, we identify gaps in our understanding of legacy effects and reveal that changes in basin sediment dynamics precede instrumented records. These sediment dynamics are not generally incorporated into interpretations of contemporary records, although their potential legacy effects are substantial. The identification of legacy effects may prove to be a fundamental component of landscape management and effective conservation and restoration practice.",

		"abstract": "In a 15-year case study, we used the multiple streams approach (MSA) and the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) to examine a controversial industry-led proposal for increased harvest of Crown forests in New Brunswick, Canada, in an adversarial policy subsystem. Study participants were queried on their perceptions of policy problems and reasons for community attention, the relationship between science and policy, and whether policy decisions were consistent with scientific understanding. Thematic analysis was used to examine interview data for evidence of Kingdon's MSA and Sabatier's ACF. During public hearings of a Legislative Select Committee on Wood Supply, two competing policy alternatives emerged. The first, put forward by the forest industry coalition, advocated an intensive forest management approach in support of a competitive industry. The second, supported by the conservation coalition, largely made up of scientists and environmental groups, focused on adaptive management, an ecosystem approach, and greater public input. This counterproposal forestalled the industry from placing its proposal on the government 2005 decision agenda. However, in 2014, the government unexpectedly adopted essentially the same industry proposal. Although the MSA provided a better explanation of the factors critical to the 2014 policy change, i.e., a declining provincial economy and a change of key government personnel, the ACF offered a nuanced perspective on the need for a professional forum to facilitate policy-oriented learning across competing coalitions. In 2014, the lack of such a forum and a closed process limited policy alternatives considered by elected officials. Results also emphasize the importance of how legislators choose to interact with experts and scientists, particularly within an adversarial subsystem, especially when a powerful coalition develops ways to limit the access to decision makers by competing coalitions.",

However, there have been few studies and little direct evidence that leaf-litter microbial communities are affected by disturbance-induced watershed condition, particularly in boreal streams. To test this linkage, we compare the associations of stream physical–chemical characteristics with landscape features (e.g., percent wetlands, roads, riparian woody stem diversity), and leaf-litter microbial activity and structure in streams across varying disturbance-induced watershed conditions. Our findings suggest that the increased stream water conductivity associated with roads can have a negative impact on leaf-litter microbial extracellular enzyme activity associated with a decrease in the abundance of Betaproteobacteria. Wetlands and forests in contrast are important providers of dissolved organic carbon that stimulates the microbial, and in particular fungal, cycling of energy and nutrients. We present a novel and in-depth perspective of leaf-litter microbial communities as a critical link to our understanding and management of the influences of watershed condition on aquatic ecosystems.",

Presently, 9% of the public forests in the province has been planted; at current planting rates, this will increase to 17% by the year 2030. Plantations established between 1967 and 1982 differ little from the natural forest they replaced in terms of total softwood content, but differ markedly by having much higher jack pine and much lower red spruce contents.

		"abstract": ". Forests are vital to maintaining headwater stream integrity in forested biomes, which ensures the delivery of aquatic ecosystem services downstream. Forest harvesting, however, can alter land – water linkages and compromise stream integrity. Historically, the main effects of forestry on streams have been documented by studies that used relatively few (mainly abiotic) indicators and which focused on single harvesting events. However, forest management is expected to intensify in the future to meet increasing global wood demand and it is likely that our present understanding does not adequately capture the cumulative effects that streams will be subjected to under intensive forest management. To address this, we assessed the effects of varying forest management intensities on the integrity of 15 forest headwater streams in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We used a comprehensive approach to link multiple biotic and abiotic indicators of stream ecosystem integrity to reach- and catchment-level characteristics including forest management (e.g., cumulative harvesting over time, road density, forest condition). Most indicators detected the gradient in forest management intensity with abiotic indicators responding most strongly. Streams in catchments with highest management intensity (especially road density) tended to have higher ﬁ ne inorganic sediment deposition and entrainment, water cations and carbon, dissolved organic matter humi ﬁ cation, and water temperature. These abiotic differences were associated with higher bio ﬁ lm biomass and shredder densities, but lower leaf decomposition. Evidence from our multi-indicator approach elucidated a potential effects pathway of higher inorganic sediment content in bio ﬁ lms of organic matter potentially limiting or altering its use by microbial and benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities and resulting in reduced leaf decomposition rates. Overall, this study shows that current best management practices in an intensively managed watershed (and legacy effects from past management such as older road systems) do not fully protect against an increased delivery of terrestrial materials to streams with resulting habitat and biotic changes, but that they are mostly effective at preventing the impairment of BMI communities.",

To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector‐gatherers (25–75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Though effects of forest harvesting on small streams are well documented, little is known about the cumulative effects in downstream systems. The hierarchical nature and longitudinal connectivity of river networks make them fundamentally cumulative, but lateral and vertical connectivity and instream processes can dissipate the downstream transport of water and materials. To elucidate such effects, we investigated how a suite of abiotic indicators changed from small streams to larger downstream sites (n=6) within three basins ranging in forest management intensity (intensive, extensive, minimal) in New Brunswick (Canada) in the summer and fall of 2017 and 2018. Inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and water temperatures significantly increased longitudinally, whereas nutrients and the fluorescence index of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; indication of terrestrial source) decreased. However, some longitudinal trends differed across basins and indicated downstream cumulative (inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and to a lesser extent DOC concentration and humification) as well as dissipative (temperatures, nutrients, organic sediments) effects of forest management. Overall, we found that the effects previously reported for small streams with managed forests also occur at downstream sites and suggest investigating whether different management practices can be used within the extensive basin to reduce these cumulative effects.",

		"abstract": "The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a downstream shift in the reliance of aquatic consumers from terrestrial to aquatic carbon sources, but this concept has rarely been assessed with longitudinal studies. Similarly, there are no studies addressing how forestry related disturbances to the structure of headwater food webs manifest (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether forest management alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1) autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to larger downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management (New Brunswick, Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food web length compare among three basins with different forest management intensity [intensive (harvest and replanting), extensive (harvest only), minimal] to detect potential cumulative/dissipative effects; and 3) forest management intensity and other catchment variables are influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as predicted, the reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector feeders) on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded stream was higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90% for some taxa). However, this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not observed within the extensively managed basin and was weaker within the intensively managed one, suggesting that forest management can alter food web dynamics along the river continuum. The dampening of downstream autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony observed in small streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream through the river continuum.",

		"abstract": "Forests play a major role in maintaining healthy streams and in providing ecosystem services such as clean drinking water, flood/drought protection and biodiversity, but studies have shown that some forestry operations can compromise these benefits. To assess whether current forest management practices impact stream ecosystems, a five-year study was conducted in J.D. Irving, Limited’s Black Brook Forestry District (New Brunswick, Canada) and in other watersheds with varying forest management intensity. This study was divided into two phases, with each addressing one main research question: 1) how different intensities of forest management affect the ecological health of headwater streams and, 2) whether the changes observed in headwater streams accumulate or dissipate in larger downstream rivers. A comprehensive approach to examining these research questions was taken by measuring multiple abiotic and biotic indicators to assess the integrity of stream ecosystems (sediments, water chemistry, insect communities, leaf decomposition, fish condition, mercury concentrations). The purpose of this paper is: 1) to synthesize the results of numerous scientific articles, and 2) to present the science and management implications in terms that regulatory and industrial forest managers can use to incorporate the lessons learned into their decision making. Results in Phase I show that streams in the most intensively managed catchments had greater inputs of terrestrial materials such as sediments, and these were incorporated into food webs, resulting in more terrestrial diets of aquatic consumers. The important stream function of leaf litter breakdown was negatively influenced by increased management intensity. Management practices related to roads warrant special attention, as roads tended to be more related to changes in stream indicators than tree removal. Additionally, results suggest that wet riparian areas were more sensitive to disturbance than drier riparian areas, which has implications for riparian buffer zone configurations. Regarding Phase II, some of the effects of forest management on small streams accumulated in larger downstream rivers (e.g., sediments, use of terrestrial resources by aquatic organisms), while others dissipated (e.g., water temperature, mercury contents). Interestingly, the impacts of forest management on streams were greater in the basin with tree removal but less silviculture than in the basin with more of both, suggesting that greater overall intensity of forest practices does not necessarily translate into greater environmental impacts, for example when considering partial versus clearcut harvesting. Overall, the study suggests that while current best management practices do not eliminate all effects, they do still offer good protection of biological integrity downstream.",

To date, the majority of studies of freshwater ecosystems have relied on bulk analyses of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to obtain information about DOM cycling. The problem with this approach is that the biogeochemical significance of DOM can only partially be elucidated using bulk analyses alone because bulk measures cannot detect most carbon and nitrogen transformations. Advances in fluorescence spectroscopy provide an alternative to traditional approaches for characterizing aquatic DOM, and allow for the rapid and precise characterization of DOM necessary to more comprehensively trace DOM dynamics. It is within this context that we discuss the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to provide a novel approach to tackling a longstanding problem: understanding the dynamics and biogeochemical role of DOM. We highlight the utility of fluorescence characterization of DOM and provide examples of the potential range of applications for incorporating DOM fluorescence into ecological studies in the hope that this rapidly evolving technique will further our understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.",

On upland boreal sites, stand productivity may initially be constrained by microclimatic conditions. However, increasing nutrient demands and overstory light interception associated with canopy development may place progressively greater emphasis on nutrient availability, profile water storage capacity and asymmetric competition. We illustrate these effects using 20-yr post-harvest data from fourteen jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) installations in northern Ontario.  Initial growth and ten-year survival were as great or greater without forest floors (NFF), but by year 15 dominant height increments were usually greater with intact forest floors (FF). Growing season frost occurrence and high vapor pressure deficits occurred more frequently with FF than NFF treatments during the initial stand establishment phase. Similarly, mean growing season soil temperatures were 2-5˚C warmer with NFF during this phase, with stand Leaf Area Index (LAI) values",

		"abstract": "Abstract Soils are losing increasing amounts of carbon annually to freshwaters as dissolved organic matter (DOM), which, if degraded, can accelerate climate change. DOM is more susceptible to degradation closer to its source and becomes increasingly dominated by the same, difficult-to-degrade compounds as degradation proceeds. However, the processes underlying DOM degradation across environments are poorly understood. Here we found DOM changed similarly along soil-aquatic gradients irrespective of differences in environmental conditions. Using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we tracked DOM along soil depths and hillslope positions in forest headwater catchments and related its composition to soil microbiomes and physical chemistry. Along depths and hillslopes, carbohydrate-like and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like compounds increased in mass, suggestive of microbial reworking of plant material. More than half of the variation in the abundance of these compounds was related to the expression of genes essential for degrading plant-derived carbohydrates. Our results implicate continuous microbial reworking in shifting DOM towards universal compounds in soils. By synthesising data from the land-to-ocean continuum, we suggest these processes can generalise across ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Such general degradation patterns can be leveraged to predict DOM composition and its downstream reactivity along environmental gradients to inform management of soil-to-stream carbon losses.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by a range of stressors arising from diverse human-caused land and water uses. Identifying the relative importance of single stressors and understanding how multiple stressors interact and jointly affect biology is crucial for River Basin Management.  This study addressed multiple human-induced stressors and their effects on the aquatic flora and fauna based on data from standard WFD monitoring schemes. For altogether 1095 sites within a mountainous catchment, we used 12 stressor variables covering three different stressor groups: riparian land use, physical habitat quality and nutrient enrichment. Twenty-one biological metrics calculated from taxa lists of three organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes) served as response variables. Stressor and response variables were subjected to Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) analysis to identify stressor hierarchy and stressor interactions and subsequently to Generalised Linear Regression Modelling (GLM) to quantify the stressors standardised effect size.  Our results show that riverine habitat degradation was the dominant stressor group for the river fauna, notably the bed physical habitat structure. Overall, the explained variation in benthic invertebrate metrics was higher than it was in fish and macrophyte metrics. In particular, general integrative (aggregate) metrics such as % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa performed better than ecological traits (e.g. % feeding types). Overall, additive stressor effects dominated, while significant and meaningful stressor interactions were generally rare and weak.  We concluded that given the type of stressor and ecological response variables addressed in this study, river basin managers do not need to bother much about complex stressor interactions, but can focus on the prevailing stressors according to the hierarchy identified.",

Diagnostic tools of multicollinearity include the variance inflation factor (VIF), condition index and condition number, and variance decomposition proportion (VDP). The multicollinearity can be expressed by the coefficient of determination (Rh2) of a multiple regression model with one explanatory variable (Xh) as the model's response variable and the others (Xi [i not equal h]) as its explanatory variables. The variance (sigmah2) of the regression coefficients constituting the final regression model are proportional to the VIF. Hence, an increase in Rh2 (strong multicollinearity) increases sigmah2. The larger sigmah2 produces unreliable probability values and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. The square root of the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to each eigenvalue from the correlation matrix of standardized explanatory variables is referred to as the condition index. The condition number is the maximum condition index. Multicollinearity is present when the VIF is higher than 5 to 10 or the condition indices are higher than 10 to 30. However, they cannot indicate multicollinear explanatory variables. VDPs obtained from the eigenvectors can identify the multicollinear variables by showing the extent of the inflation of sigmah2 according to each condition index. When two or more VDPs, which correspond to a common condition index higher than 10 to 30, are higher than 0.8 to 0.9, their associated explanatory variables are multicollinear.

		"abstract": "Abstract   In this paper we describe how forest management practices in Fennoscandian countries, namely Sweden and Finland, expose streams to multiple stressors over space and time. In this region, forestry includes several different management actions and we explore how these may successively disturb the same location over 60-100 year long rotation periods. Of these actions, final harvest and associated road construction, soil scarification, and/or ditch network maintenance are the most obvious sources of stressors to aquatic ecosystems. Yet, more subtle actions such as planting, thinning of competing saplings and trees, and removing logging residues also represent disturbances around waterways in these landscapes. We review literature about how these different forestry practices may introduce a combination of physicochemical stressors, including hydrological change, increased sediment transport, altered thermal and light regimes, and water quality deterioration. We further elaborate on how the single stressors may combine and interact and we consequently hypothesise how these interactions may affect aquatic communities and processes. Because production forestry is practiced on a large area in both countries, the various stressors appear multiple times during the rotation cycles and potentially affect the majority of the stream network length within most catchments. We concluded that forestry practices have traditionally not been the focus of multiple stressor studies and should be investigated further in both observational and experimental fashion. Stressors accumulate across time and space in forestry dominated landscapes, and may interact in unpredictable ways, limiting our current understanding of what forested stream networks are exposed to and how we can design and apply best management practices.",

		"abstract": "[1]Paired watershed studies have limited researchers wishing to disentangle road and harvesting effects on peak flows or to study management schemes other than the existing scenario. The outcomes of many paired watershed studies examining peak flows have also recently been challenged since only an approach that pairs peak flows by frequency can adequately evaluate the effects of harvesting on peak flows. This study takes advantage of a model that has been developed and extensively tested at a site containing a rich set of internal catchment process observations to examine the isolated and combined effects of roads and harvesting on the peak flow regime of a snow-dominated catchment for return periods of up to 100 years. Contrary to the prevailing perception in forest hydrology, the effects of harvesting are found to increase with return period, which is attributable to the uniqueness of peak flow runoff generation processes in snow-dominated catchments. Planned harvesting (50% harvest area) is found to have a significant effect (9%–25% over control) on peak flows with recurrence intervals ranging 10–100 years. Peak flow frequency increases after harvesting increase with return period, with the largest events (100 year) becoming 5–6.7 times more frequent, and medium-sized events (10 year) becoming 1.7–2 times more frequent. Such changes may have substantial ecological, hydrological, and geomorphological consequences within the watershed and farther downstream. Study findings suggest that peak flow regimes are fairly tolerant to the current level of harvesting in this particular watershed but that further harvesting may affect this element significantly.",

Because these models often involve many parameters (one slope per response per predictor), they pose challenges to model interpretation. Among these challenges, we lack quantitative frameworks for estimating the overall importance of single predictors in multi‐response regression models. Here we demonstrate that commonality analysis and hierarchical partitioning, widely used for both estimating predictor importance and improving the interpretation of single‐response regression models, are related and complementary frameworks that can be expanded for the analysis of multiple‐response models. In this application, we (a) demonstrate the mathematical links between commonality analysis, variation and hierarchical partitioning; (b) generalize these frameworks to allow the analysis of any number of predictor variables or groups of predictor variables as in the case of variation partitioning; and (c) introduce and demonstrate the implementation of these generalized frameworks in the R package rdacca.hp.",

The fundamental importance of freshwater resources, the rapid extinction rate among freshwater species and the pronounced sensitivity of freshwater ecosystems to climate change together signal a pre-eminent need for renewed scientific focus and greater resources. Against this background, the Freshwater Biological Association in 2008 launched a new series of ‘summit’ Conferences in Aquatic Biology intended to develop and showcase the application of ecological science to major issues in freshwater management.\n\n\n\n2. This collection of studies arose from the first summit entitled ‘Multiple Stressors in Freshwater Ecosystems’. Although freshwater science and management are replete with mutiple-stressor problems, few studies have been designed explicitly to untangle their effects.\n\n\n\n3. The individual case studies that follow reveal the wide array of freshwaters affected by multiple stressors, the spatial and temporal scales involved, the species and ecosystem processes affected, the complex interactions between ecology and socioeconomics that engender such effects, the approaches advocated to address the problems and the challenges of restoring affected systems. The studies also illustrate the extent to which new challenges are emerging (e.g. through climate change), but also they develop a vision of how freshwaters might be managed sustainably to offset multiple stressors in future.\n\n\n\n4. More generically, these case studies illustrate (i) how freshwaters might be at particular risk of multiple-stressor effects because of conflicts in water use, and because the hydrological cycle vectors stressor effects so effectively and so extensively; (ii) that dramatic, nonlinear, ‘ecological surprises’ sometimes emerge as multiple-stressor effects develop and (iii) that good ecology and good ecologists add considerable value to other freshwater disciplines in understanding multiple stressors and managing their effects.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of our approach was to take into account the nested spatial scales driving stream functioning in the description of pressures/ecological status links by analysing the results of a hierarchical model. The development of this model has allowed us to answer the following questions: Does the consideration of the indirect links between anthropogenic pressures and stream ecological status modify the hierarchy of pressure types impacting benthic invertebrates? Do the different nested scales play different roles in the anthropogenic pressures/ecological status relationship? Does this model lead to better understanding of the specific role of hydromorphology in the evaluation of stream ecological status?  To achieve that goal, we used the Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling method to develop a structural model linking variables describing (i) land use and hydromorphological alterations at the watershed scale, (ii) hydromorphological alterations at the reach scale, (iii) nutrients-organic matter contamination levels at the site scale, and (iv) substrate characteristics at the sampling site scale, to explain variation in values of a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index: the French I 2 M 2 .  We have highlighted the importance of land use effects exerted on both hydromorphological and chemical characteristics of streams observed at finer scales and their subsequent indirect impact on stream ecological status. Hydromorphological alterations have an effect on the substrate mosaic structure and on the concentrations of nutrients and organic matter at site scale. This result implies that stream hydromorphology can have a major indirect effect on macroinvertebrate assemblages and that the hierarchy of impacts of anthropogenic pressures on stream ecological status generally described in the literature - often determining strategic restoration priorities - has to be re-examined. Finally, the effects of nutrients and organic matter on macroinvertebrate assemblages are lower than expected when all the indirect effects of land use and hydromorphological alterations are taken into account.",

Pre-commercial (PCT) and commercial thinning (CT) are important silvicultural tools applied to spruce-fir ( Picea - Abies ) forests, a key forest type in the northeastern portion of North America. However, the long-term influences of CT, particularly when combined with PCT, are relatively unknown, except for a few specific locations in the region. Utilizing the repeated measurements from replicated experimental research sites (n = 15) initiated in the early 2000s throughout Maine, we quantified the influence of contrasting thinning treatments on spruce-fir stands with prior PCT and without a prior PCT (NoPCT). Thinning treatments at the nine sites with a prior PCT were a combination of multiple entry timings (immediate, 5-, and 10-year delay) and removal intensities (0, 33, and 50 % relative density reduction). At the six NoPCT sites, the CT treatments were a combination of thinning methods (dominant, crown, and low) and removal intensities (0, 33, and 50 %). The most effective CT in terms of large tree response, sawlog volume, and stand value were immediate CT rather than delayed treatments after PCT, and low thinning in NoPCT stands. Dominant thinning in NoPCT showed detrimental effects on residual stand conditions leading to the lowest yield and generated product values. In general, the earlier CT entry in PCT stands led to greater long-term benefits of the treatment in terms of tree size, merchantable volume, and financial value of the stand. No thinning treatment significantly enhanced cumulative total volume or merchantable volume or financial value compared to unthinned controls because even though thinning enhanced sawlog production, unthinned stands produced more pulpwood and studwood. Although we did not find significant economic benefits of CT in stands with or without PCT, light low thinning in NoPCT, and light crown thinning without delay in PCT could be an optimal strategy to maximize the average merchantable stem size without compromising the total stand value, while providing additional benefits to stand composition and generating mid-rotation revenue. Overall, the findings highlight some complexities and challenges with effective thinning regimes in highly shade-tolerant conifer species.",

		"abstract": "Ecological stressors (i.e. environmental factors outside their normal range of variation) can mediate each other through their interactions, leading to unexpected combined effects on communities. Determining whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the linear combination of their individual effects (i.e. an additive expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative null models that base their predictions on the effects of single stressors on community properties (e.g. species richness or biomass) do not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model, which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level. Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of ecological surprises on communities based on community property null models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the responses of individual species to the community level as does our compositional null model.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Here we identify limitations restricting the development of multiple-stressor management strategies and address these, bridging theory and practice, within a novel empirical framework. Those critical limitations include that (i) monitoring schemes fall short of accounting for theory on relationships between multiple-stressor interactions and ecological responses, (ii) current empirical modelling approaches neglect the prevalence and intensity of multiple-stressor interactions, and (iii) mechanisms of stressor interactions are often poorly understood. We offer practical recommendations for the use of empirical models and experiments to predict the effects of freshwater degradation in response to changes in multiple stressors, demonstrating this approach in a case study. Drawing on our framework, we offer practical recommendations to support the development of effective management strategies in three general multiple-stressor scenarios.",

		"abstract": "The importance of terrestrial-aquatic linkages was evaluated by a large-scale, 3-year exclusion of terrestrial leaf litter inputs to a forest stream. Exclusion of leaf litter had a strong bottom-up effect that was propagated through detritivores to predators. Most invertebrate taxa in the predominant habitat declined in either abundance, biomass, or both, compared with taxa in a nearby reference stream. However, fauna in moss habitats changed little, indicating that different food webs exist in habitats of different geomorphology. Thus, the ecosystem-level consequences of excluding detrital inputs to an ecosystem were demonstrated. Inputs of riparian detritus are essential for conservation or restoration of diverse stream food webs.",

Previous studies of harvest impacts on stream chemistry from deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover have shown variable responses and recovery times. We hypothesized that this variability in response and recovery was due to the interactive effects of forest harvesting with regional and global environmental changes. We investigated harvest impacts on stream solute (K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cl – , SO 4 2– , DOC, Si, NO 3 – , NH 4 + , total P) concentrations, pH and conductivity under clearcut, selection, and shelterwood harvesting using a before-after control-impact experimental approach. The experiment was conducted at the Turkey Lakes Watershed, a shade-tolerant sugar maple forest within the Boreal Shield Ecozone, over a 36 year period (15 year pre-harvest and 21 year post-harvest) that has experienced climate change and acidification recovery. Harvest impacts on stream chemistry were greatest in the clearcut, moderate in the selection cut, and least in the shelterwood cut. The largest impacts on stream solutes typically lasted one to six years following harvest, although some solutes were impacted during the entire 21 year post-harvest period. Different patterns in the response of stream solute concentrations included: initial deviations (increase or decrease) followed by a return to pre-harvest levels within two to four years (Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , conductivity); initial increase followed by a decrease but still not recovered (K + ); initial increase followed by a decrease to below pre-harvest levels (NO 3 – , Na + , Cl - ); sustained elevated concentrations (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Si); and a noisy response (TP, SO 4 2- , pH). The different patterns were consistent with expected changes in nutrient demand, sources, and transport (including changes in hillslope-stream hydrologic connectivity due to harvesting). Comparing harvest impacts to long-term climate change and acidification recovery showed that harvesting had antagonistic (mitigative) effects to environmental changes for some solutes (e.g., cations), while for others (e.g., DOC) harvesting had agonistic (synergistic) effects to environmental changes. These results emphasize the need for long-term monitoring to accurately interpret the consequences of forest harvesting practices on the resilience of forests experiencing environmental change.",

As integrators of local catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41%) than synergistic (28%), additive (16%) or reversed (15%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adaptation to multiple stressors.",

Of most significance is our finding, both from the survey and, in particular, the experiment, of a variety of complex interactions among the stressors.\n\n4\nSynthesis and applications. The development of indices of stream health that distinguish the effects of sediment from those of nutrients should help prioritize catchment management actions.

		"abstract": "Studies on the interactive responses to multiple simultaneously acting stressors have focused on individual or population-level responses in laboratory microcosms, while field-based studies on community-level responses are rare. We examined the influence of a natural (non-anthropogenic acidity) vs. human-induced stress (land drainage) and their interaction on species richness and spatial turnover (β diversity) of stream diatom, bryophyte, and benthic invertebrate communities. Our four stream categories were: circumneutral reference, circumneutral impacted, naturally acidic, and naturally acidic impacted streams. We expected the most sensitive species to be present only in the circumneutral reference streams. Therefore, species richness should be highest in these streams and lowest in the naturally acidic streams additionally stressed by forest drainage. Alternatively, communities in acidic streams may consist of the most tolerant taxa that are unaffected by further stressors, species richness in these streams remaining unaffected by drainage. We also expected spatial turnover to be highest in the circumneutral near-pristine streams and lowest in the drainage-impacted acidic streams. In all three taxonomic groups, α diversity was lower in the naturally acidic than in circumneutral streams. The additional impact of the anthropogenic stress on species richness varied between groups, having no effect on diatoms, antagonistic effect on bryophytes, and additive effect on invertebrates. We also found differences in how each stressor modified β diversity of each taxonomic group. For diatoms, β diversity showed an overall tendency to decrease with increasing stress level, while bryophyte β diversity responded mainly to forest drainage. Benthic invertebrate β diversity did not differ between treatments. Our results suggest that non-additive effects among stressors need special attention to improve the understanding and management of multifactor responses in streams. Our results also argue for the primacy of a multi-taxon approach to environmental impact detection, and for the inclusion of a wide array of ecological responses, particularly community turnover, in bioassessment programs to detect responses that may go unnoticed by conventional richness-based measures.",

The area suffers a sprawling urbanization which is leading to major alterations in water quality, hydrology and morphology of streams. These water bodies are known as effluent-dominated streams, because most of the baseflow is given by Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) discharges. In this paper, a 5 year long assessment of Lura stream is presented and the collected data is discussed to understand overall ecological quality. Multivariate analysis carried out on macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental variables suggests that invertebrate communities suffer severe alteration both upstream and downstream WWTP discharges. Results indicate that the high polluting loads coming from WWTP discharges affect seriously the stream water quality, but the most important cause of impairment are pulse perturbations related to the modified hydrology, causing droughts and flash floods, and to the spills of untreated sewage from overflows during rain events.",

		"abstract": "SUMMARY 1. Streams are highly connected to their landscapes and so are easily altered by multiple stressors that affect both uplands and riparian zones, and the streams themselves. These include dams and diversions, channelisation, deforestation, water pollution, biological invasions and climate change. 2. We review research conducted in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, which measured the effects of many of these stressors on both stream food webs and fluxes of invertebrates to and from the riparian zone that feed aquatic and terrestrial consumers. About half the energy that sustains fish falls directly into streams as terrestrial invertebrates, and a quarter of the energy needs for riparian birds is supplied by adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream. 3. Single stressors in these Hokkaido streams, including deforestation, channelisation, erosion-control dams, biological invasions and climate change, have drastic effects on stream food webs, the fishes they support and riparian predators (spiders, birds, and bats). Most stressors caused 30–90% declines in foraging, growth, or abundance of aquatic or terrestrial predators. Indirect effects of stressors also cascaded throughout stream food webs and across the aquatic–terrestrial boundary. 4. Effects of individual stressors were largely concordant across spatial scale, through time during years of different productivity and among different food web components. 5. Two studies of multiple stressors revealed that each stressor alone reduced food web components like abundance of stream benthos or riparian spiders to low levels (35–83% reduction; mean 59%), beyond which an additional stressor had little effect. Synergism and antagonism are less relevant when individual stressors have such large effects. 6. Thematic implications: small streams in Hokkaido are highly sensitive to many individual stressors and have little resistance or resilience to their effects. Moreover, each stressor alone can reduce biota strongly, indicating that restoration will need to consider all simultaneously to protect biotic diversity.",

These increases are the result of multiple environmental drivers, but the relative importance of the drivers is still unclear. We analyzed a dataset of &gt;10 000 observations of riverine total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and associated water chemistry and hydrological observations from 1993 to 2017. The observations span a ∼600 km north–south gradient from 30 individual river systems in Finland. Our data show significantly increasing TOC concentrations in 25 out of 30 systems, with an average increase from 12.0 to 15.1 mg l −1 . The observed increase in riverine TOC concentrations led to an increase of 0.28 Mt in annual TOC load to the Baltic Sea from 1993 level to 2017 level. We analyzed the role of three putative environmental drivers of the observed TOC trends. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the most common driver was discharge, which alone explained TOC increases in 13 rivers, whereas pH and temperature were less important drivers (sole predictor in one and zero rivers, respectively). Different permutations of these three drivers were also found to be significant; the combination of discharge and pH being the most common (4 rivers). Land use was not in general linked with trends in TOC, except for the proportion of ditched land in the catchment, which was significantly correlated with increases in TOC concentration. Land use showed significant relationships with trends in discharge and pH. We also found that catchment characteristics are regulating the extent of these regional or global environmental changes causing the upward trends of riverine organic carbon.",

		"abstract": "The potential for complex synergistic or antagonistic interactions between multiple stressors presents one of the largest uncertainties when predicting ecological change but, despite common use of the terms in the scientific literature, a consensus on their operational definition is still lacking. The identification of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed insituations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of “mitigating synergism” is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain etal. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of the interpretation of synergism and antagonism insituations where individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Multiple stressors threaten biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, imposing new challenges to ecosystem management and restoration. Ecosystem managers are required to address and mitigate the impact of multiple stressors, yet the knowledge required to disentangle multiple-stressor effects is still incomplete. Experimental studies have advanced the understanding of single and combined stressor effects, but there is a lack of a robust analytical framework, to address the impact of multiple stressors based on monitoring data. Since 2000, the monitoring of Europe's waters has resulted in a vast amount of biological and environmental (stressor) data of about 120,000 water bodies. For many reasons, this data is rarely exploited in the multiple-stressor context, probably because of its rather heterogeneous nature: stressors vary and are mixed with broad-scale proxies of environmental stress (e.g. land cover), missing values and zero-inflated data limit the application of statistical methods and biological indicators are often aggregated (e.g. taxon richness) and do not respond stressor-specific. Here, we present a ‘cookbook’ to analyse the biological response to multiple stressors using data from biomonitoring schemes. Our ‘cookbook’ includes guidance for the analytical process and the interpretation of results. The ‘cookbook’ is accompanied by scripts, which allow the user to run a stepwise analysis based on his/her own data in R, an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Using simulated and real data, we show that the recommended procedure is capable of identifying stressor hierarchy (importance) and interaction in large datasets. We recommend a minimum number of 150 independent observations and a minimum stressor gradient length of 75% (of the most relevant stressor's gradient in nature), to be able to reliably rank the stressor's importance, detect relevant interactions and estimate their standardised effect size. We conclude with a brief discussion of the advantages and limitations of this protocol.",

		"abstract": "Climate and land-use change drive a suite of stressors that shape ecosystems and interact to yield complex ecological responses (that is, additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects). We know little about the spatial scales relevant for the outcomes of such interactions and little about effect sizes. These knowledge gaps need to be filled to underpin future land management decisions or climate mitigation interventions for protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems. This study combines data across scales from 33 mesocosm experiments with those from 14 river basins and 22 cross-basin studies in Europe, producing 174 combinations of paired-stressor effects on a biological response variable. Generalized linear models showed that only one of the two stressors had a significant effect in 39% of the analysed cases, 28% of the paired-stressor combinations resulted in additive effects and 33% resulted in interactive (antagonistic, synergistic, opposing or reversal) effects. For lakes, the frequencies of additive and interactive effects were similar for all spatial scales addressed, while for rivers these frequencies increased with scale. Nutrient enrichment was the overriding stressor for lakes, with effects generally exceeding those of secondary stressors. For rivers, the effects of nutrient enrichment were dependent on the specific stressor combination and biological response variable. These results vindicate the traditional focus of lake restoration and management on nutrient stress, while highlighting that river management requires more bespoke management solutions. A cross-scale analysis of paired-stressor effects on biological variables of European freshwater ecosystems shows that in 39% of cases, significant effects were limited to single stressors, with nutrient enrichment being the most important of these in lakes. Additive and interactive effects were similarly frequent (ca. 30% each), this frequency being independent of the spatial scale of analysis for lakes but increasing with scale for rivers.",

		"abstract": "Global environmental change is driven by multiple anthropogenic stressors. Conservation and restoration require understanding the individual and joint action of these stressors to evaluate and prioritize management measures. To date, most studies on multiple stressor effects have sought to identify potential stressor interactions, defined as deviations from null models, and related meta-analyses have focused on quantifying the relative proportion of stressor interactions across studies. These studies have provided valuable insights about the complexity of multiple stressor effects, but remain largely devoid of a theoretical framework for null model selection and prediction of effects. We suggest that multiple stressor research would benefit by (1) integrating and developing additional null models and (2) selecting null models based on their mechanistic assumptions of the stressor mode of action and organism sensitivities as well as stressor-effect relationships for individuals and populations. We present a range of null models and outline their underlying assumptions and application in multiple stressor research. Moving beyond mere description requires multiple stressor research to shift its focus from identifying statistically significant interactions to the use and development of mechanistic (null) models. Justified selection of the appropriate null model is a first step to achieve this.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Worldwide, multiple stressors that often lead to complex and non-linear biological responses affect stream ecosystems. Combined stressor effects on ecologically diverse and functionally important macroinvertebrate communities are often difficult to assess (such as species-specific responses of many species, effects of different stressors and stressor levels in concert). A central limitation is taxonomic resolution applied for specimen identification in such studies. DNA metabarcoding can resolve taxonomy and provide greater insights into multiple stressor effects. This was detailed by results of a recent multiple stressor mesocosm experiment, where only for the dipteran family Chironomidae 183 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) could be distinguished. Numerous OTUs showed very different response patterns to multiple stressors. In this study, we applied DNA metabarcoding to assess multiple stressor effects on all non-chironomid invertebrates from the same experiment. In the experiment, we applied three stressors (increased salinity, fine sediment deposition, reduced flow velocity) in a full-factorial design. Afterwards, 99,498 macroinvertebrates were sampled from two microhabitats, i.e. streambed and leaf litter. We compared stressor responses inferred through DNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial COI gene to responses based on morphotaxonomic taxa lists. We identified 435 OTUs, of which 122 OTUs were assigned to EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa. The most common 35 OTUs alone showed 15 different response patterns to the experimental manipulation, ranging from insensitivity to any applied stressor to sensitivity to single and multiple stressors. These response patterns even comprised differences within one family. The species-specific taxonomic resolution and the inferred response patterns to stressors highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding in the context of multiple stressor research, even for well-known taxa such as EPT species.",

Theoretically, the actions of individual stressors can be delineated based on associated changes in functional traits and these relationships should be generalizable across communities comprised of different species. Thus, combining trait perspectives with community composition data could help to identify the relative influence of different stressors. We evaluated the utility of this combined approach by quantifying shifts in fish species and trait composition in Lake Erie during the past 50 years (1969-2018) in relation to human-driven changes in nutrient inputs, climate warming, and biological invasions. Species and trait shifts were also compared between two Lake Erie basins, which differ in their environmental and biological characteristics, to identify trait responses that were generalizable across different ecosystems versus those that were context dependent. Our analyses revealed consistent species changes across basins, and shifts in feeding and thermal traits, that were primarily associated with altered nutrient inputs (oligotrophication followed by eutrophication). We found no or inconsistent trait-based evidence for the effects of warming and two invasive fishes. Context-dependent trait responses were also evident; nutrient inputs were related to shifts in species tolerant of turbidity in the shallow, eutrophic western basin, which contrasted to shifts between benthopelagic and benthic species in the deeper central basin. Our results reveal the dominant effects of specific stressors on a large freshwater lake and offer a framework for combining species-based and trait-based approaches to delineate the impacts of simultaneous stressors on communities of perturbed natural ecosystems.",

However, the majority of studies have mainly focused on the direct effect of human activities on a single group, despite the fact that anthropogenically induced biodiversity loss in ecosystems occurs across multiple trophic levels and may depend on both altered habitat (e.g., water chemistry) and on trophic interactions cascading up the trophic network. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous direct, water-chemistry mediated and trophic network cascading effects of the overall human-impact intensification on density (biomass/abundance) and richness (number of taxa) across all trophic levels in pond ecosystems. For this, we collected and combined multi-taxon data (341 taxa) for macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates, and fishes. We showed that human-impact intensification affected the densities and richness of almost all trophic levels across the study ecosystems, and resulted in an overall negative effect on the multitrophic diversity of the entire community. We detected direct effect of human-impact intensification, but no indirect effects, on the richness of primary producers. In contrast, the indirect effects mediated through the nutrient content in the water were the most influential drivers of multitrophic diversity in the invertebrate communities. At the same time, the indirect effects through the trophic network cascades were detected mainly within the fish community. Our findings improve the mechanistic understanding of multitrophic diversity responses in ponds under the ongoing intensification of anthropogenic pressure.",

		"abstract": "Understanding and predicting how multiple co-occurring environmental stressors combine to affect biodiversity and ecosystem services is an on-going grand challenge for ecology. So far progress has been made through accumulating large numbers of smaller-scale individual studies that are then investigated by meta-analyses to look for general patterns. In particular there has been an interest in checking for so-called ecological surprises where stressors interact in a synergistic manner. Recent reviews suggest that such synergisms do not dominate, but few other generalities have emerged. This lack of general prediction and understanding may be due in part to a dearth of ecological theory that can generate clear hypotheses and predictions to tested against empirical data. Here we close this gap by analysing food web models based upon classical ecological theory and comparing their predictions to a large (546 interactions) dataset for the effects of pairs of stressors on freshwater communities, using trophic- and population-level metrics of abundance, density, and biomass as responses. We find excellent overall agreement between the stochastic version of our models and the experimental data, and both conclude additive stressor interactions are the most frequent, but that meta-analyses report antagonistic summary interaction classes. Additionally, we show that the statistical tests used to classify the interactions are very sensitive to sampling variation. It is therefore likely that current weak sampling and low sample sizes are masking many non-additive stressor interactions, which our theory predicts to dominate when sampling variation is removed. This leads us to suspect ecological surprises may be more common than currently reported. Our results highlight the value of developing theory in tandem with empirical tests, and the need to examine the robustness of statistical machinery, especially the widely-used null models, before we can draw strong conclusions about how environmental drivers combine.",

Currently, existing modelling approaches fall short in simulating the responses of macroinvertebrate assemblages to environmental constraints, lacking incorporation of the multiple spatial and temporal scales on which stressors act, including their mutual interactions and uncertainties associated with input data. In answer to these shortcomings, this study aimed to design a conceptual multiscale model for simulating responses of macroinvertebrate assemblages to multiple environmental stressors. To this purpose, we drew up model requirements, selected model building blocks and assembled these into a conceptual model, also documenting the challenges that remain to be solved. This conceptual model offers a direction for simulating responses of macroinvertebrate assemblages to multiple stressors, which in turn can be used to better focus management resources and restoration practices.",

The MOO engine identifies Pareto front strategies that are trade-offs between environmental objectives for water bodies and the effort required for reducing the pressures. The web interface provides tools to set the effort perceived by different river basin stakeholders considering technical feasibility, political difficulty, and social acceptability of the alternative options.

Due to the co-occurrence of stressors and a lack of appropriate data, the effects on large rivers are difficult to elucidate. To overcome this problem, we developed a partial canonical correspondence analyses (pCCA) model using 292 benthic invertebrate taxa from 104 sites that incorporated the effects of three stressors groups: hydromorphology, land use, and water quality. The data covered an environmental gradient from near-natural to heavily altered sites in five large rivers in Southeastern Europe. Prior to developing the multi-stressor model, we assessed the importance of natural characteristics on individual stressor groups. Stressors proved to be the dominant factors in shaping benthic invertebrate assemblages. The pCCA among stressor-groups showed that unique effects dominated over joint effects. Thus, benthic invertebrate assemblages were suitable for disentangling the specific effect of each of the three stressor groups. While the effects of hydromorphology were dominant, both water quality and land use effects were nearly equally important. Quantifying the specific effects of hydromorphological alterations, water quality, and land use will allow water managers to better understand how large rivers have changed and to better define expectations for ecosystem conditions in the future.",

Currently, progress has been made through accumulating large numbers of smaller-scale empirical studies that are then investigated by meta-analyses to detect general patterns. There is particular interest in detecting, understanding, and predicting 'ecological surprises' where stressors interact in a non-additive (e.g., antagonistic or synergistic) manner, but so far few general results have emerged. However, the ability of the statistical tools to recover non-additive interactions in the face of data uncertainty is unstudied, so crucially, we do not know how well the empirical results reflect the true stressor interactions. Here, we investigate the performance of the commonly implemented additive null model. A meta-analysis of a large (545 interactions) empirical dataset for the effects of pairs of stressors on freshwater communities reveals additive interactions dominate individual studies, whereas pooling the data leads to an antagonistic summary interaction class. However, analyses of simulated data from food chain models, where the underlying interactions are known, suggest both sets of results may be due to observation error within the data. Specifically, we show that the additive null model is highly sensitive to observation error, with non-additive interactions being reliably detected at only unrealistically low levels of data uncertainty. Similarly, plausible levels of observation error lead to meta-analyses reporting antagonistic summary interaction classifications even when synergies co-dominate. Therefore, while our empirical results broadly agree with those of previous freshwater meta-analyses, we conclude these patterns may be driven by statistical sampling rather than any ecological mechanisms. Further investigation of candidate null models used to define stressor-pair interactions is essential, and once any artefacts are accounted for, the so-called 'ecological surprises' may be more frequent than was previously assumed.",

Physical, chemical, and biological stressors follow characteristic patterns of occurrence, intensity, and frequency, linked to human pressure and socio-economic settings. The societal perception of stressor effects changes when moving from broad geographic regions to narrower basin or waterbody scales, as political and ecologically based perspectives change across scales. Current approaches relating the stressor effects on river networks and human societies fail to incorporate complexities associated to their co-occurrence, such as: i) the evidence that drivers can be associated to different stressors; ii) their intensity and frequency may differ across spatial and temporal scales; iii) their differential effects on biophysical receptors may be related to their order of occurrence; iv) current and legacy stressors may produce unexpected outcomes; v) the potentially different response of different biological variables to stressor combinations; vi) the conflicting effects of multiple stressors on ecosystem services; and, vii) management of stressor effects should consider multiple occurrence scales. We discuss how to incorporate these aspects to present frameworks considering biophysical and societal consequences of multiple stressors, to better understand and manage the effects being caused on river networks.",

The disturbance in the first year may have minimal impact on the hydrologic integrity of the watershed, but if the disturbance in the following year is added to the first, and the disturbance in year 3 added to those in years 1 and 2, the net effect may be detrimental to the beneficial uses of the stream.

Many states have established regulatory temperature thresholds, referred to as numeric criteria, to protect cold‐water fishes such as salmon and trout. We examined across‐year and within‐year patterns of exceedance at control and treatment stream temperature probes. Determining whether an exceedance at the downstream end of a harvest was unambiguously related to harvest proved surprisingly difficult. The likelihood of a site exceeding its numeric criterion appeared related, in part, to the site's preharvest temperature range. Four control reaches as well as three preharvest treatment reaches exceeded their numeric criteria, necessitating additional analysis to evaluate timber harvest impacts. Nine percent of sites (3 of 33) both exceeded their numeric criteria and exhibited a potential harvest effect (16.7% of private sites [3 of 18], 0% of State sites [0 of 15]). After harvest, exceedances were typically observed in only the first of the two post‐harvest years. These findings highlight the importance of including temporal and spatial controls in temperature assessments of numeric criteria when the assessment's purpose is to determine whether exceedances are related to human activities.",

Optimum composite fingerprints for use in sediment source discrimination and apportionment comprised 137Cs and 210Pbex for the control catchment (LUC) throughout the study and for the treatment catchment (LUT) during the pre-harvest period, and 137Cs and soil organic matter during harvest and post-harvest periods for LUT. Prior to harvesting, the dominant sediment source to the sediment load in both catchments was the stream channel and remained relatively constant throughout the study for LUC. For the entire study period the total suspended sediment yield from LUT (3,160 kg ha-1) approximately doubled that from LUC (1,650 kg ha-1). Most of this difference is accounted for by the increase in sediment output during the rainy months following clearcutting. The disturbance associated with forest operations in LUT caused the contributions to the load from the catchment slopes and forest roads to increase markedly (total contributions 835 and 795 kg ha-1, respectively). However, the total contribution from the stream channel for LUT during the study period (1,530 kg ha-1) remained similar to that from LUC. The results of the investigation demonstrated that any attempt to reduce sediment loading from forest harvesting would require adopting best management practices to reduce sediment mobilization from catchment surfaces and forest roads.",

		"abstract": "Paired catchment studies have documented the extent to which forest harvesting impairs forested watersheds. Adverse effects on stream water quality and aquatic ecosystems following ground-based harvesting operations that open forest canopies and compact soils have spurred the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) that are intended to limit runoff volumes (i.e., water yield increase, WYI) and total sediment yields (TSY) into streams. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent insights from water and sediment yield studies, ranging in scale from hillslope plots to catchments, that reveal the sources and mechanisms of hydrological impairment and recovery, and point to specific strategies for developing more targeted BMPs that help prevent, mitigate, and rehabilitate forested watersheds. In the context of forested watersheds, contemporary BMPs have successfully lowered runoff (WYI) and total sediment yields (TSY) relative to previously reported values. Recent research strongly indicates that the delivery of WYIs and TSYs to streams following forest harvesting is still high. Because many factors such as the intensity and extent of management activities and headwater catchment activities interact, improving the effectiveness of generic, inflexible BMPs will be challenging. Recent findings indicate that a site-specific, highly tailored application of a combination of BMP measures before, during, and after the harvesting operation is needed if a further reduction of runoff and sediment delivery to streams is to be achieved. Analyses of 155 paired catchment studies and 39 hillslope plots revealed that forest harvesting resulted in average increases of WYI by 180mm (+46%) and TSY by 477 t km−2year−1 (+700%). Smaller hillslope plots established on forest roads, skid trails, and harvested areas underestimate these values (WYI of 8.2mm, TSY was 42.2 t km−2year−1). In extreme circumstances such as clearcutting, enhanced WYI and TSY may persist up to several decades before returning to pre-harvest levels. WY increased with increasing precipitation and with, and proportional to, the catchment area harvested, regardless of climatic zone or tree species composition; TSY increased with increasing rainfall and catchment area. Both the impact of harvesting and the time required for natural recovery of hydrologic responses depended on the response but can be shortened when applying contemporary forestry BMPs.",

		"abstract": "Harvesting of forests causes a range of disturbances, including changes to hydrology, nutrient inputs, water quality, food sources, habitat structure and channel morphology, which can impact streams over several years and are reflected in changes in community structure. We aimed to determine the relative magnitudes of impact and rates of recovery of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, and associated changes in biotic indices (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index and an Index of Biotic Integrity), in reaches of different sized streams within progressively logged catchments. We conducted annual summer surveys over seventeen years in fifteen New Zealand streams that differed in size (upstream catchment area between 40 and 2360 ha, mean channel widths between 2.5 and 16 m) and harvest intensity in the surrounding catchment. The largest post-harvest changes in biotic indices and community structures occurred in streams draining relatively small to medium catchments ( 40% of the upstream catchment had been harvested, and particularly after harvesting of overstorey riparian vegetation adjacent to study reaches. The impacts of harvest on invertebrate communities were less evident in wider streams draining catchments over 500 ha, but the largest changes from pre-harvest biotic indices and community structure still generally occurred after harvesting of riparian vegetation along these streams. The changes in community structure after harvesting of riparian vegetation typically included increases in the densities of Diptera, Mollusca and Oligochaetes, and decreases in the densities of Ephemeroptera. These results demonstrate that impacts on benthic macroinvertebrate communities increased as the proportion of upstream catchment harvested increased and/or after riparian vegetation was harvested. Some of the communities in headwater streams had largely recovered towards pre-harvest structures, whereas post-harvest recovery was less evident in relatively large streams, over the duration of the study.",

		"abstract": "Multiple stressors, such as warming and invasions, often occur together and have nonadditive effects. Most studies to date assume that stressors operate in perfect synchrony, but this will rarely be the case in reality. Stressor sequence and overlap will have implications for ecological memory – the ability of past stressors to influence future responses. Moreover, stressors are usually defined in an anthropocentric context: what we consider a short-term stressor, such as a flood, will span multiple generations of microbes. We argue that to predict responses to multiple stressors from individuals to the whole ecosystem, it is necessary to consider metabolic rates, which determine the timescales at which individuals operate and therefore, ultimately, the ecological memory at different levels of ecological organization.",

These initiatives have both inspired and been inspired by global assessments of tree and forest attributes and their contributions to offset carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Here we use data from more than 130,000 national forest inventory plots to describe the contribution of nearly 1.4 trillion trees on forestland in the conterminous United States to mitigate CO2 emissions and the potential to enhance carbon sequestration capacity on productive forestland. Forests and harvested wood products uptake the equivalent of more than 14% of economy-wide CO2 emissions in the United States annually, and there is potential to increase carbon sequestration capacity by ∼20% (−187.7 million metric tons [MMT] CO2 ±9.1 MMT CO2) per year by fully stocking all understocked productive forestland. However, there are challenges and opportunities to be considered with tree planting. We provide context and estimates from the United States to inform assessments of the potential contributions of forests in climate change mitigation associated with tree planting.",

Fate of tree root necromass depends on fungal communities developing on the decaying roots. Local environmental conditions which affect composition of tree root mycobiome may also influence fungal communities developing on decaying tree roots. Here, we assessed fungal communities associated with decaying roots of Picea abies decomposing in three microhabitats: soil with no vegetation, soil with ericoid shrubs cover, and P. abies deadwood, for a 2-year period. Forest microhabitat showed stronger effect on structuring fungal communities associated with decaying roots compared to living roots. Some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi showed higher relative abundance on decaying roots in soils under ericoid shrub cover, while saprotrophic fungi had higher relative abundance in roots decomposing inside deadwood. Regardless of the studied microhabitat, we observed decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi and increase of endophytic fungi during root decomposition. Interestingly, we found substantially more fungal taxa with unknown ecology in late stages of root decomposition, indicating that highly decomposed roots may represent so far overlooked niche for soil fungi. Our study shows the importance of microhabitats on the fate of the decomposing spruce roots.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   The richness of saproxylic species is commonly found to be compromised in managed forests. However, it is often less clear if this reflects local scarcity of high quality deadwood objects or changes to the overall forest structure. Further, anthropogenic and natural drivers working at the landscape scale may have a strong impact. Hence, it is difficult to give detailed advice on how to conserve biodiversity in a cost-effective manner. Here we explored macrofungal richness on deadwood across a gradient of forest management intensity in Danish Fagus sylvatica forests. We aimed to disentangle the importance of habitat quality per se from the effects of variables recorded at the forest stand and landscape scales. Data was collected from 40 beech stands, each representing one of four broad management types: conventionally managed, near-to-nature managed, recently unmanaged and long unmanaged. Stands were aggregated within six larger forest clusters, to account for variation at the landscape scale. Fungal species were recorded as fruitbodies on deadwood at five decay stages. We found that the four management types showed strong differences in fungal richness, deadwood volume and forest structure, with long unmanaged stands having notably higher structural complexity and species richness. Fungal species richness and presence of red-listed fungi appeared to be mainly driven by deadwood volume, tree species and decay stage, but some stand-level variables such as canopy gaps, basal area and stand age were also of importance. Lying coarse deadwood had the highest species richness while standing coarse woody debris and fine deadwood had lower species density. Saproxylic fungal richness on individual deadwood objects was largely affected by resource quality and size, which is often limited in managed forests. Our results indicate that the best measure to increase fungal species richness, especially in managed stands, is to increase the amount of large diameter deadwood.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate (i) effects of tree species on DOC production and (ii) relationships between litter decomposition and the amount and quality of DOC. Five different types of leaves and needles were exposed in litterbags at two neighboring forest sites. Within 12 months we sampled the litterbags five times and leached aliquots of field moist litter in the laboratory. In the collected litter percolates we measured DOC concentrations and recorded UV and fluorescence spectra in order to estimate the aromaticity and complexity of the organic molecules. Furthermore, we investigated the biodegradability of DOC from fresh and decomposed litter during 6 weeks incubations. Fresh sycamore maple litter released the largest amounts of DOC reaching about 6.2% of litter C after applying precipitation of 94mm. We leached 3.9, 1.6, 1.0 and 3.3% carbon from fresh mountain ash, beech, spruce and pine litter, respectively. In the initial phase of litter decomposition significantly decreasing DOC amounts were released with increasing litter mass loss. However, after mass loss exceeds 20% DOC production from needle litter tended to increase. UV and fluorescence spectra of percolates from pine and spruce litter indicated an increasing degree of aromaticity and complexity with increasing mass loss as often described for decomposing litter. However, for deciduous litter the relationship was less obvious. We assume that during litter decomposition the source of produced DOC in coniferous litter tended toward a larger contribution from lignin-derived compounds. Biodegradability of DOC from fresh litter was very high, ranging from 30 to 95% mineralized C. DOC from degraded litter was on average 34% less mineralizable than DOC from fresh litter. Taking into account the large DOC production from decomposed needles we can assume there is an important role for DOC in the accumulation of organic matter in soils during litter decomposition particularly in coniferous forests.",

		"abstract": "The fate of terrestrially-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important to carbon (C) cycling in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, and recent evidence suggests that climate warming is influencing DOC dynamics in northern ecosystems. To understand what determines the fate of terrestrial DOC, it is essential to quantify the chemical nature and potential biodegradability of this DOC. We examined DOC chemical characteristics and biodegradability collected from soil pore waters and dominant vegetation species in four boreal black spruce forest sites in Alaska spanning a range of hydrologic regimes and permafrost extents (Well Drained, Moderately Well Drained, Poorly Drained, and Thermokarst Wetlands). DOC chemistry was characterized using fractionation, UV–Vis absorbance, and fluorescence measurements. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating the samples and measuring CO2 production over 1 month. Soil pore water DOC from all sites was dominated by hydrophobic acids and was highly aromatic, whereas the chemical composition of vegetation leachate DOC varied significantly with species. There was no seasonal variability in soil pore water DOC chemical characteristics or biodegradability; however, DOC collected from the Poorly Drained site was significantly less biodegradable than DOC from the other three sites (6% loss vs. 13–15% loss). The biodegradability of vegetation-derived DOC ranged from 10 to 90% loss, and was strongly correlated with hydrophilic DOC content. Vegetation such as Sphagnum moss and feathermosses yielded DOC that was quickly metabolized and respired. In contrast, the DOC leached from vegetation such as black spruce was moderately recalcitrant. Changes in DOC chemical characteristics that occurred during microbial metabolism of DOC were quantified using fractionation and fluorescence. The chemical characteristics and biodegradability of DOC in soil pore waters were most similar to the moderately recalcitrant vegetation leachates, and to the microbially altered DOC from all vegetation leachates.",

We investigated C, N, and P mineralization patterns of pine litter, oak and a mixture of various species commonly found in wetland landscape position. Litter species were incubated (alone and with soils) under laboratory conditions in the dark for 120 days. Samples were leached weekly and the leachates were analyzed for pH, E4:E6 ratio, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total N, NO3, NH4, soluble reactive P, and total P. CO2 effluxes during the 120-d incubation period were measure using NaOH traps. Carbon loss was calculated as the sum of DOC and CO2 effluxes. Results indicated that patterns of C and N release varied with litter species and soil type. Mix species treatment resulted in larger DOC and N pulses compared to pine and oak treatments. The majority of the DOC, N, and P leached was retained by the soils. When litters were added to the soils, a greater proportion of the C was lost as CO2, while litter incubated alone lost more C as DOC. This result demonstrated the importance of the soil microbial community affecting the patterns of litter mineralization. Total N concentration and C:N ratio of the litter species were significantly correlated to C loss.",

In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, molecular analyses play an important role in studies of soil dwelling animals, for example in taxonomy, phylogeography or food web analyses. The quality of the DNA, used for later molecular analyses, is an important factor and depends on collection and preservation of samples prior to DNA extraction. Ideally, DNA samples are frozen immediately upon collection, but if samples are collected in the field, suitable preservation methods might be limited due to unavailability of resources or remote field sites. Moreover, shipping samples over long distances can cause loss of DNA quality e.g. by thawing or leaking of preservation liquid. In this study we use earthworms, a key organism in soil research, to compare three different DNA preservation methods – freezing at −20 °C, storing in 75% ethanol, and freeze drying. Samples were shipped from the United States of America to Austria. The DNA of the samples was extracted using two different extraction methods, peqGOLD™ and Chelex® 100. The DNA amplification success was determined by amplifying four DNA fragments of different length. The PCR amplification success is significantly influenced by preservation method and extraction method and differed significantly depending on the length of the DNA fragment. Freeze drying samples was the best preservation method when samples were extracted using the silica based extraction method peqGOLD™. For samples that were extracted with Chelex® 100, storage in ethanol was the best preservation method. However, the overall amplification success was significantly lower for the extraction procedure based on Chelex® 100. The detection of the small DNA fragments was higher and independent from the extraction method, while the amplification success was significantly reduced for the longer DNA fragments., We recommend freeze drying of DNA samples, especially when they have to be shipped for longer distances. No special packaging or declaration is needed for freeze dried samples, and the risk of thawing is excluded. Storage of freeze dried samples also reduces costs because samples can be kept at room temperature in a desiccator. It should be noted, that the extraction methods showed significant differences in DNA amplification success. Thus, the extraction method should be taken into account when choosing the preservation method., \n          \n            \n              •\n              How to best store and ship DNA samples generated in the USA for analyses in Austria?\n            \n            \n              •\n              Different preservation and extraction methods are compared by analysing tissue samples.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Freeze drying is the recommended preservation method, especially when samples have to be shipped.\n            \n            \n              •\n              The DNA amplification success is influenced by preservation and extraction method.",

		"abstract": "The market for forest products has diversified to include biomass energy products sourced from materials that were typically left on-site after harvest. In this study we examined whether intensified biomass removal following harvest will effect site soil biological diversity and metabolic functioning, and how decisions surrounding sampling, in sites prepared with disc-trenching soil scarification, influence the effect assessment of harvesting activities. We compared the influence of harvesting, below-ground biomass removal, stem only versus full tree harvesting, micro-topographic features and seasonal effects on soil biota. We assessed soil biotic changes using potential enzyme activity assays and metabarcoding using targeted primers for four groups (arthropods, bacteria, fungi and broad eukaryotes). We found that harvesting and forest floor removal had strong influences on soil biotic communities, with changes that generally favoured more general soil saprotrophy and reductions in plant-associated organisms. Disc-trenching created differences between micro-topographic features where organic soil was redistributed and trenches, where it was removed. We found no significant difference to how seasonal variation effected communities in harvested sites, compared to unharvested sites. These results show that there is significant site heterogeneity due to disc scarification, and that the sampling micro-topographic features should be considered during study design. Additional studies are needed to assess the effects of higher biomass removal on these features as these sites age.",

Microbial communities vary substantially in space and time, between soil types and under different land management. The mechanisms that control the spatial distributions of soil microbes are largely unknown as we have not been able to adequately upscale a detailed analysis of the microbiome in a few grams of soil to that of a catchment, region or continent. Here we reveal that soil microbes along a 1000 km transect have unique spatial structures that are governed mainly by soil properties. The soil microbial community assessed using Phospholipid Fatty Acids showed a strong gradient along the latitude gradient across New South Wales, Australia. We found that soil properties contributed the most to the microbial distribution, while other environmental factors (e.g., temperature, elevation) showed lesser impact. Agricultural activities reduced the variation of the microbial communities, however, its influence was local and much less than the overall influence of soil properties. The ability to predict the soil and environmental factors that control microbial distribution will allow us to predict how future soil and environmental change will affect the spatial distribution of microbes.",

The analysis of PLFAs extracted from soils can provide information about the overall structure of terrestrial microbial communities. PLFA profiling has been extensively used in a range of ecosystems as a biological index of overall soil quality, and as a quantitative indicator of soil response to land management and other environmental stressors., The standard method presented here outlines four key steps: 1. lipid extraction from soil samples with a single-phase chloroform mixture, 2. fractionation using solid phase extraction columns to isolate phospholipids from other extracted lipids, 3. methanolysis of phospholipids to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and 4. FAME analysis by capillary gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Two standards are used, including 1,2-dinonadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC(19:0/19:0)) to assess the overall recovery of the extraction method, and methyl decanoate (MeC10:0) as an internal standard (ISTD) for the GC analysis.",

		"abstract": "Field collections of environmental samples, for example corals, for molecular microbial analyses present distinct challenges. The lack of laboratory facilities in remote locations is common, and preservation of microbial community DNA for later study is critical. A particular challenge is keeping samples frozen in transit. Five nucleic acid preservation methods that do not require cold storage were compared for effectiveness over time and ease of use. Mixed microbial communities of known composition were created and preserved by DNAgard™, RNAlater®, DMSO–EDTA–salt (DESS), FTA® cards, and FTA Elute® cards. Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and clone libraries were used to detect specific changes in the faux communities over weeks and months of storage. A previously known bias in FTA® cards that results in lower recovery of pure cultures of Gram-positive bacteria was also detected in mixed community samples. There appears to be a uniform bias across all five preservation methods against microorganisms with high G + C DNA. Overall, the liquid-based preservatives (DNAgard™, RNAlater®, and DESS) outperformed the card-based methods. No single liquid method clearly outperformed the others, leaving method choice to be based on experimental design, field facilities, shipping constraints, and allowable cost.",

		"abstract": "With the advances of sequencing tools, the fields of environmental microbiology and soil ecology have been transformed. Today, the unculturable majority of soil microbes can be sequenced. Although these tools give us tremendous power and open many doors to answer important questions, we must understand how sample processing may impact our results and interpretations. Here, we test the impacts of four soil storage methods on downstream amplicon metabarcoding and qPCR analyses for fungi and bacteria. We further investigate the impact of thaw time on extracted DNA to determine a safe length of time during which this can occur with minimal impact on study results. Overall, we find that storage using standard cold packs with subsequent storage at −20°C is little different than immediate storage in liquid nitrogen, suggesting that the historical and current method is adequate. We further find evidence that storage at room temperature or with aid of RNAlater can lead to changes in community composition and in the case of RNAlater, lower gene copies. We therefore advise against these storage methods for metabarcoding analyses. Finally, we show that over 1 month, DNA extract thaw time does not impact diversity or qPCR metrics. We hope that this work will help researchers working with soil bacteria and fungi make informed decisions about soil storage and transport to ensure repeatability and accuracy of results and interpretations.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether sample preservation can affect the yield of nucleic acid extracts from environmental samples. Storage of microbial samples was studied using three sediment types of varying carbon contents (10–57% carbon of dry weight). Four different storage solutions were tested at three temperatures. Freezing of samples at −20 °C or −80 °C, either without preservative or in phenol–chloroform solution, retained nucleic acid quantities very efficiently. Storage of samples in phenol–chloroform solution at +4 °C also gave good yields except for sediment with extremely high-carbon content. Ethanol and RNAlater® preservation decreased nucleic acid yields drastically at all temperatures. To study how sample preservation may affect the result of microbial community analysis, one type of sediment was selected for length heterogeneity-PCR analysis and PCR cloning of the 16S rRNA genes. Ethanol and RNAlater® preservation caused a slight bias towards certain microbial types in the community analyses shown by underrepresentation of Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria-affiliated peak sizes and overrepresentation of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Alphaproteobacteria-affiliated peak sizes. Based on the results of this study, preservation in phenol–chloroform solution can be recommended as an alternative storage method when freezing is not possible such as during extended field sampling; however, ethanol and RNAlater® may cause serious problems when used as preservatives for environmental samples containing humic acids.",

Four Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) provenance trials in Quebec were used to test the hypothesis that a more vigorous growth would not occur at the expense of marginalizing available nutrient pools. On these sites, the provenance showing the greatest overall productivity (high treatment) and the one showing the lowest productivity (low treatment) were studied. The divergence in total aboveground nutrient contents between the high and low treatments was high in all sites (i.e., 161%–209%). Increased nutrient immobilization in trees did not cause any significant soil depletion of available base cations or total N at any site. Moreover, exchangeable Ca concentrations, cation-exchange capacity, and exchangeable Ca pools in the forest floor were significantly higher in the high treatment. It is concluded that in the short term, increased nutrient immobilization in trees does not create an apparent depletion of available base cations, perhaps because of a stimulation of soil mineral weathering and (or) a better retention of nutrients by the trees. Also, an effort to simulate mineral weathering using PROFILE showed the need for model improvement for applications at the plot level.",

		"abstract": "Culture-independent survey techniques are fundamental tools when assessing plant microbiomes. These methods rely on DNA that is carefully preserved after collecting samples to achieve meaningful results. Immediately freezing samples to -80°C after collection is considered one of the most robust methods for preserving samples before DNA extraction but is often impractical. Preservation solutions can solve this problem, but commercially available products are expensive, and there is limited data comparing their efficacy with other preservation methods. In this study, we compared the impact of three methods of sample preservation on plant microbiome surveys: (1) RNAlater, a proprietary preservative, (2) a home-made salt-saturated dimethyl sulphoxide preservation solution (DESS), and (3) freezing at -80°C. DESS-preserved samples, stored at room temperature for up to four weeks, did not show any significant differences to samples frozen at -80°C, while RNAlater inflated bacterial alpha diversity. Preservation treatments did not distinctively influence fungal alpha diversity. Our results demonstrate that DESS is a versatile and inexpensive preservative of DNA in plant material for diversity analyses of fungi and bacteria.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Background Plants can recruit beneficial microbes to enhance their ability to defend against pathogens. However, in contrast to the intensively studied roles of the rhizosphere microbiome in suppressing plant pathogens, the collective community-level change and effect of the phyllosphere microbiome in response to pathogen invasion remains largely elusive. Results Here, we integrated 16S metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics and culture-dependent methods to systematically investigate the changes in phyllosphere microbiome between infected and uninfected citrus leaves by Diaporthe citri , a fungal pathogen causing melanose disease worldwide. Multiple microbiome features suggested a shift in phyllosphere microbiome upon D . citri infection, highlighted by the marked reduction of community evenness, the emergence of large numbers of new microbes, and the intense microbial network. We also identified the microbiome features from functional perspectives in infected leaves, such as enriched microbial functions for iron competition and potential antifungal traits, and enriched microbes with beneficial genomic characteristics. Glasshouse experiments demonstrated that several bacteria associated with the microbiome shift could positively affect plant performance under D . citri challenge, with reductions in disease index ranging from 65.7 to 88.4%. Among them, Pantoea asv90 and Methylobacterium asv41 identified as “recruited new microbes” in the infected leaves, exhibited antagonistic activities to D . citri both in vitro and in vivo, including inhibition of spore germination and/or mycelium growth. Sphingomonas spp. presented beneficial genomic characteristics and were found to be the main contributor for the functional enrichment of iron complex outer membrane receptor protein in the infected leaves. Moreover, Sphingomonas asv20 showed a stronger suppression ability against D . citri in iron-deficient conditions than iron-sufficient conditions, suggesting a role of iron competition during their antagonistic action. Conclusions Overall, our study revealed how phyllosphere microbiomes differed between infected and uninfected citrus leaves by melanose pathogen, and identified potential mechanisms for how the observed microbiome shift might have helped plants cope with pathogen pressure. Our findings provide novel insights into understanding the roles of phyllosphere microbiome responses during pathogen challenge.",

Using non-targeted metabolomics, we compared the effects of a single freeze-thaw or dry-wet event on microbial metabolism in an agricultural soil with and without plants. We showed that a dry-wet cycle had a greater impact on solute and metabolite concentrations in the unplanted soil than a freeze-thaw cycle. Drying or freezing caused increases in dissolved organic C, sugars and polyols, suggesting enhanced microbial production to alleviate temperature or moisture stress. Increased nucleobase concentration in the unplanted soil after a dry-wet cycle, and increased amino acids following both stresses, suggested a breakdown of microbial DNA and proteins released from damaged cells. The impacts of stress on metabolites in the planted soil were less than in the unplanted soil. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the soil microbial community responds quickly to stress events by accumulating osmotic solutes (e.g. sugars and polyols) and that a freeze-thaw event causes less disruption than dry-rewetting, and that plants have a key role in the mitigation of the freezing or drying effects on soil microbial communities.",

The different methodologies can lead to distinct outcomes, which has been demonstrated especially in studies investigating prokaryotic community composition. Eukaryotic microbes are ubiquitous, diverse, and increasingly a subject of investigation in addition to bacteria and archaea. However, little is known about how the choice of DNA preservation and extraction methodology impacts perceived eukaryotic community composition. In this study, we compared the effect of two DNA preservation methods and six DNA extraction methods on the community profiles of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes in phototrophic biofilms on seagrass (Zostera marina) leaves from the Baltic Sea. We found that, whereas both DNA preservation and extraction method caused significant bias in perceived community composition for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, extraction bias was more pronounced for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes. In particular, soft-bodied and hard-shelled eukaryotes like nematodes and diatoms, respectively, were differentially abundant depending on the extraction method. We conclude that careful consideration of DNA preservation and extraction methodology is crucial to achieving representative community profiles of eukaryotes in marine biofilms and likely all other habitats containing diverse eukaryotic microbial communities.",

Yet, the research area exploring interactions between bacteria-fungi and microbiota-plants, within the context of a pathobiome, is still scarce. In this study, the impact of olive knot (OK) disease caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv) on the epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities of olive tree twigs from three different cultivars, was investigated in field conditions. The ITS-DNA sequencing of cultivable fungi, showed that OK disease disturbs the resident fungal communities, which may reflect changes in the habitat caused by Psv. In particular, a reduction on epiphyte abundance and diversity, and changes on their composition were observed. Compared to epiphytes, endophytes were less sensitive to OK, but their abundance, in particular of potential pathogens, was increased in plants with OK disease. Host genotype, at cultivar level, contributed to plant fungal assembly particularly upon disease establishment. Therefore, besides fungi - Psv interactions, the combination of cultivar - Psv also appeared to be critical for the composition of fungal communities in olive knots. Specific fungal OTUs were associated to the presence and absence of disease, and their role in the promotion or suppression of OK disease should be studied in the future.",

Here, water lily leaves are employed as a study model to investigate the relationship between bacterial microbiomes, biodegradation, and fossilization. We compare four DNA extraction kits to reduce biases in interpretation and to identify the most suitable kit for the extraction of DNA from bacteria associated with biofilms on decaying water lily leaves for 16S rRNA amplicon analysis. Methods We extracted surface-associated DNA from Nymphaea leaves in early stages of decay at two water depth levels using four commercially available kits to identify the most suitable protocol for bacterial extraction, applying a mock microbial community standard to enable a reliable comparison of the kits. Results Kit 4, the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil, resulted in high DNA concentrations with better quality and yielded the most accurate depiction of the mock community. Comparison of the leaves at two water depths showed no significant differences in community composition. Discussion The success of Kit 4 may be attributed to its use of bead beating with a homogenizer, which was more efficient in the lysis of Gram-positive bacteria than the manual vortexing protocols used by the other kits. Our results show that microbial composition on leaves during early decay remains comparable and may change only in later stages of decomposition.",

The molecular analysis of bacterial populations inhabited in soil faces difficulties in obtaining high yield and high purity of DNA, and different commercial DNA extraction kits have been developed for this purpose. This study focuses on the comparison of DNA extraction of six different rice root-associated bacterial consortium using three commercial kits with two key technologies, spin-column adsorption and magnetic bead adsorption. The quality and quantity of genomic DNA obtained from these extraction methods were analyzed and compared based on DNA concentration, DNA purity and efficiency to be used as a template for 16sRNA amplification. The results showed that the extraction kit with magnetic bead adsorption technology showed the highest concentration (101.32 ng/μl) compared to other DNA extraction kits (32.67 and 1.89 ng/μl). The purity values (A260/A280) were assessed by using Nano-drop spectrophotometer and resulted in purities of nucleic acids in the range of 1.4-1.7. Thus, it was concluded that the extracted DNA obtained from the extraction kit with magnetic bead adsorption technology can be valuable for molecular analysis of microbial communities present in the soil.",

As the plant microbiome can be highly complex, low-cost, high-throughput methods such as amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene are often preferred for characterizing its microbial composition and diversity. However, the selection of appropriate methodology when conducting such experiments is critical for reducing biases that can make analysis and comparisons between samples and studies difficult. This protocol describes in detail a standardized methodology for the collection and extraction of DNA from soil, rhizosphere, and root samples. Additionally, we highlight a well-established 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing pipeline that allows for the exploration of the composition of bacterial communities in these samples, and can easily be adapted for other marker genes. This pipeline has been validated for a variety of plant species, including sorghum, maize, wheat, strawberry, and agave, and can help overcome issues associated with the contamination from plant organelles.",

These plant-associated microbial communities are reservoirs of microbial diversity and they can be important for plant health. The characterization of microbial communities in diverse plants, such as Espeletia plants that are endemic to the Paramo ecosystem in the Andes Mountains, can shed light regarding possible interactions among microorganisms and microbial functional properties. Obtaining DNA from plant endophytic microbial communities involves various steps to ensure that samples are free of contamination from microorganisms present on the plant surface (epiphytes).

		"abstract": "The phyllosphere represents the largest surface area of any terrestrial habitat and is colonized by a diverse and specialized community of microorganisms which include epiphytes, saprophytes and phytopathogens (Andrews and Hirano 1991). This specialization has been reflected in studies which distinguish leaf isolates from soil or rhizosphere bacteria of the same genus (Thompson et al. 1993a). The phyllosphere is highly variable both within and between plant species where the diversity of microflora can be enhanced by non-resident colonisers dispersed by wind and rain and via animal faeces. To survive this harsh environment, leaf colonisers have to respond rapidly to extremes of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet irradiation and nutrient concentrations which fluctuate over short periods of time (O’Brian and Lindow 1988). The ability of bacteria to exhibit a broad range of phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity) by the habitat dependent expression of a subset of genes has been proposed as an important survival mechanism for bacteria in highly variable environments such as the leaf (Lindow 1993). Despite studies which describe microbial diversity and population succession in maturing plants, the microbiology of the leaf remains poorly understood. Of the common residents, pseudomonads have been best studied. Detailed investigations by extraction and plate count enumeration demonstrate that pseudomonads and other epiphytes exhibit diurnal fluctuations in population densities and a log-normal distribution in this habitat (Hirano and Upper 1989).",

		"abstract": "Biofilm-associated, sessile communities represent the major bacterial lifestyle, whereas planktonic cells mainly appear during initial colonization of new surfaces. Previous research, mainly performed with pathogens, demonstrated increased environmental stress tolerance of biofilm-growing compared to planktonic bacteria. The lifestyle-specific stress response of colonic microbiota, both natural and fermentation produced, has not been addressed before. Planktonic and sessile \"artificial\" colonic microbiota delivered by PolyFermS continuous fermentation models can provide a controllable and reproducible alternative to fecal transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disorders. We therefore characterized planktonic and sessile microbiota produced in two PolyFermS models inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota and comparatively tested their levels of tolerance of frozen storage (-80 degrees C) and freeze-dried storage (4 degrees C) for 9 months to mimic preservation strategies for therapeutic applications. Sessile microbiota harbored next to shared taxa a unique community distinguishable from planktonic microbiota. Synergistetes and Proteobacteria were highly represented in sessile microbiota, while Firmicutes were more abundant in planktonic microbiota. The community structure and metabolic activity of both microbiota, monitored during standardized reactivation batch fermentations, were better preserved after frozen storage than dried storage, indicated by higher Bray-Curtis similarity and enhanced recovery of metabolite production. For both lifestyles, reestablishment of Bacteroidaceae was impaired after frozen and dried storage along with reduced propionate formation. In contrast, butyrate production was maintained after reactivation despite compositional rearrangements within the butyrate-producing community. Unexpectedly, the rate of recovery of metabolite production was lower after preservation of sessile than planktonic microbiota. We speculate that higher functional dependencies between microbes might have led to the lower stress tolerance of sessile than planktonic microbiota.IMPORTANCE Fecal microbiota transplantation has been successfully applied in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and has been suggested as an alternative therapy for other intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease or metabolic syndrome. \"Artificial\" colonic microbiota delivered by PolyFermS continuous fermentation models can provide a controllable and reproducible alternative to fecal transplantation, but effective preservation strategies must be developed. In this study, we systematically investigated the response of sessile and planktonic artificial colonic microbiota to cryopreservation and lyophilization. We suggest that functional redundancy is an important factor in providing functional stability with respect to exposure to stress during processing and storage. Functional redundancy in compositionally reduced microbial systems may be considered when designing microbial products for therapy.",

Due to our inability to cultivate and preserve all sorts of microorganisms, we are losing some ecologically and industrially relevant components of microbial community, due to extinction caused by environmental and climatic variations with time. Intact sample and microbiome preservation are crucial for future cultivation as well as to study the effects of ecological and climatic variations on community functionality and shift with time, using OMICS. Although, methods for pure culture preservation are almost optimized, the techniques of microbiome preservation still remain as an unsolved challenge for microbiologists due to technical and physiological constraints.

		"abstract": "The rapid rewetting of a dry soil often yields a pulse in soil CO 2  production that persists for 2 to 6 d. This phenomenon is a common occurrence in surface soils, yet the mechanism responsible for producing the CO 2  pulse has not been positively identified, We studied the effects of a single drying and rewetting event on soil C pools, to identify which specific C substrates are mineralized to produce the observed pulse in respiration rates. We labeled two soils with C-glucose and measured the enrichment and pool sizes of the released CO 2 , extractable biomass C, and extractable soil organic matter (SOM-C) throughout a drying and rewetting cycle. After rewetting, respiration rates were 475 to 370% higher than the rates measured before the dry down. The enrichment of the released CO 2  was 1 to 2 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable biomass C pools and 10 to 20 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable organic C, suggesting that the CO 2  pulse was generated entirely from the mineralization of microbial biomass C. However, there was no evidence of substantial microbial cell lysis on rewetting. We hypothesize that the pulse of CO 2  is generated by the rapid mineralization of highly enriched intracellular compounds as a response by the microbial biomass to the rapid increase in soil water potentials. The drying and rewetting process also releases physically protected SOM, increasing the amount of extractable SOM-C by up to 200%. The additional SOM-C rendered soluble by the rewetting event did not contribute substantially to the rewetting CO 2  pulse. Overall, the rapid rewetting of a dry soil can influence soil C cycling in the short-term, by increasing the microbial mineralization of cytoplasmic solutes, and in the longer-term, by decreasing the total amount of SOM physically protected within microaggregates.",

		"abstract": "In the next decades, many soils will be subjected to increased drying/wetting cycles or modified water availability considering predicted global changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. These changes may affect the turnover of C and N in soils, but the direction of changes is still unclear. The aim of the review is the evaluation of involved mechanisms, the intensity, duration and frequency of drying and wetting for the mineralization and fluxes of C and N in terrestrial soils. Controversial study results require a reappraisal of the present understanding that wetting of dry soils induces significant losses of soil C and N. The generally observed pulse in net C and N mineralization following wetting of dry soil (hereafter wetting pulse) is short-lived and often exceeds the mineralization rate of a respective moist control. Accumulated microbial and plant necromass, lysis of live microbial cells, release of compatible solutes and exposure of previously protected organic matter may explain the additional mineralization during wetting of soils. Frequent drying and wetting diminishes the wetting pulse due to limitation of the accessible organic matter pool. Despite wetting pulses, cumulative C and N mineralization (defined here as total net mineralization during drying and wetting) are mostly smaller compared with soil with optimum moisture, indicating that wetting pulses cannot compensate for small mineralization rates during drought periods. Cumulative mineralization is linked to the intensity and duration of drying, the amount and distribution of precipitation, temperature, hydrophobicity and the accessible pool of organic substrates. Wetting pulses may have a significant impact on C and N mineralization or flux rates in arid and semiarid regions but have less impact in humid and subhumid regions on annual time scales. Organic matter stocks are progressively preserved with increasing duration and intensity of drought periods; however, fires enhance the risk of organic matter losses under dry conditions. Hydrophobicity of organic surfaces is an important mechanism that reduces C and N mineralization in topsoils after precipitation. Hence, mineralization in forest soils with hydrophobic organic horizons is presumably stronger limited than in grassland or farmland soils. Even in humid regions, suboptimal water potentials often restrict microbial activity in topsoils during growing seasons. Increasing summer droughts will likely reduce the mineralization and fluxes of C and N whereas increasing summer precipitation could enhance the losses of C and N from soils.",

We describe the effect of drought on microorganisms at molecular level and their molecular responses to this life-threating challenge focusing on the production of xeroprotectants. We also review the interspecies interactions of those drought-tolerant microorganisms with other sensitive organisms including neighboring prokaryotes and eukaryotes such as plants, and the potential role of these microorganisms at determining the ecological composition of stressed environments. We emphasize the importance of applying the knowledge derived from the molecular mechanisms used by desiccation-tolerant microorganisms for the improvement of the preservation techniques.

The quality and quantity of DNA were analyzed, and the microbial community structure was investigated in all samples. The results obtained indicated that the quantity and integrity of DNA was preserved well in all samples; however, the taxonomic distribution was skewed in samples stored without any solution at ambient temperatures, particularly when analyses were performed at lower taxonomic levels. Although both solutions performed equally well, sequencing output and OTU numbers in DESS-treated samples were closer to those snap frozen with liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, DNA/RNA Shield-stored samples performed better for the preservation of rare taxa.",

		"abstract": "Aims Soil sample preservation is a challenging aspect in molecular studies on soil microbial communities. The demands for specialized sample storage equipment, chemicals and standardized protocols for nucleic acid extraction often require sample processing in a home laboratory that can be continents apart from sampling sites. Standard sampling procedures, especially when dealing with RNA, comprise immediate snap freezing of soils in liquid nitrogen and storage at −80°C until further processing. For these instances, organizing a reliable cooling chain to transport hundreds of soil samples between continents is very costly, if possible at all. In this study we tested the effect of soil sample preservation by freeze-drying with subsequent short-term storage at 4°C or ambient temperatures compared to −80°C freezing by comparative barcoding analyses of soil microbial communities. Methods Two grassland soil samples were collected in Central Germany in the Biodiversity Exploratory Hainich-Dün. Samples were freezedried or stored at −80°C as controls. Freeze-dried samples were stored at 4°C or ambient temperature. Investigated storage times for both storage temperatures were 1 and 7 days. Total DNA and RNA were extracted and bacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities were analyzed by amplicon 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S (V4-V5 variable region) and 18S (NS31-AM1 fragment) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) marker genes, respectively. Important Findings Bacterial communities were sufficiently well preserved at the rDNA and rRNA level although storage effects showed as slightly decreased alpha diversity indices for the prolonged storage of freeze-dried samples for 7 days. AM fungal communities could be studied without significant changes at the rDNA and rRNA level. Our results suggest that proper sampling design followed by immediate freeze-drying of soil samples enables short-term transportation of soil samples across continents.",

Together with their microbiota, these organisms form a singular entity, the holobiont. Sampling campaigns are required to study the microbiome of algae in natural populations, but freezing samples in liquid nitrogen is complex in the field, particularly at remote locations. Here we tested two simple alternative methods for sampling the microbial diversity associated with the kelp S. latissima: silica gel conservation of tissue and swab samples preserved in DNA/RNA shield solution. We used these techniques to compare apex and meristem samples from Roscoff (Brittany, France) and evaluated their impact on the results of 16S rDNA metabarcoding experiments. Both methods were able to separate apex and meristem microbiomes, and the results were concordant with results obtained for flash-frozen samples. However, differences were observed for several rare genera and ASVs, and the detection of contaminant sequences in the silica gel-preserved samples underline the importance of including blank samples for this method. Globally, our results confirm that the silica gel technique and swabbing combined with DNA/RNA shield preservation are valid alternatives to liquid nitrogen preservation when sampling brown macroalgae in the field. However, they also underline that, regardless of the method, caution should be taken when interpreting data on rare sequences.",

Its tremendous potential towards mediating sustainability in the ecosystem necessitates the urgent need to store it optimally and efficiently as “next-generation biologicals” for future applications via soil transplantation. The challenge, therefore, is to devise a strategy for the storage of soil microbiome such that its “functionality” is preservedfor later application. This review discusses the current endeavours made towards storage ofthe soil microbiome. The methods for assessing the integrity of soil microbiome by targeting the structural diversity and functional potential of the preserved microbiomes have also been discussed. Further, the success stories related to the storage of fecal microbiome for application in transplants have also been highlighted. This is done primarily with the objective of learning lessons, and parallel application of the knowledge gained, in bringing about improvement in the research domain of soil microbiome storage. Subsequently, the limitations of current techniques of preservation have also been delineated. Further, the open questions in the area have been critically discussed. In conclusion, possible alternatives for storage, comprehensive analyses of the composition of the stored microbiome and their potential have been presented.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   Pre-treatment of soil samples prior to analysis is acknowledged to affect microbial activity and community parameters, but recommendations are diverging and there are no best-practice or standardised laboratory protocols. For the microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) as a ratio parameter of C allocated to anabolism over total metabolised C, the effects of sample pre-treatment are unpredictable because the underlying parameters of microbial metabolism may be affected differently. In treatment or land use comparisons, it is important to know whether soils are affected in a similar way by pre-treatment. Based on five different paired sites (each with cropland and forest), the effects of six common pre-treatments were evaluated on 18O-CUE and associated parameters, i.e. respiration rate, soil microbial biomass C, total DNA extracted, and estimated abundances of fungi, bacteria and archaea. The six common pre-treatments were: (i) immediate analysis of field-fresh soil samples, and analysis following 14d pre-incubation of soil samples that were (ii) field-fresh, (iii) air-dried, (iv) oven-dried (40°C), (v) frozen at −20°C and (vi) frozen in-situ (dry ice and subsequently liquid N2). The experiment revealed two main findings. The first was that pre-incubation of 14d had the most pronounced effect and reduced microbial respiration rate, growth rate and microbial biomass C by between 28% and 63% on average compared with field-fresh samples, suggesting an impact of the reduction in readily available substrates on microbial activity. The second finding was that even after 14 days of pre-incubation, drying & rewetting caused an increase in the microbial respiration rate in forest soil samples of 64±53% (air-drying) and 86±65% (oven-drying), known as the Birch effect. However, CUE as a ratio parameter was found to be unaffected by sample pre-treatment, with only minor changes after 14d of pre-incubation. Pre-treatment (including pre-incubation) affected cropland and forest samples similarly, with one exception: the estimated abundance of fungi increased only with drying & rewetting in forest soils. This suggests that dried cropland soils could potentially yield appropriate community data, while forest soils respond to soil drying in a more complex way. It was concluded that CUE values can be derived from soil samples regardless of whether they were dried & rewetted, frozen & thawed, or stored fresh.",

		"abstract": "Drying soil samples before DNA extraction is commonly used for specific fungal DNA quantification and metabarcoding studies, but the impact of different drying procedures on both the specific fungal DNA quantity and the fungal community composition has not been analyzed. We tested three different drying procedures (freeze-drying, oven-drying, and room temperature) on 12 different soil samples to determine (a) the soil mycelium biomass of the ectomycorrhizal species Lactarius vinosus using qPCR with a specifically designed TaqMan® probe and (b) the fungal community composition and diversity using the PacBio® RS II sequencing platform. Mycelium biomass of L. vinosus was significantly greater in the freeze-dried soil samples than in samples dried at oven and room temperature. However, drying procedures had no effect on fungal community composition or on fungal diversity. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportions of fungi according to their functional roles (moulds vs. mycorrhizal species) in response to drying procedures. Only six out of 1139 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) had increased their relative proportions after soil drying at room temperature, with five of these OTUs classified as mould or yeast species. However, the magnitude of these changes was small, with an overall increase in relative abundance of these OTUs of approximately 2 %. These results suggest that DNA degradation may occur especially after drying soil samples at room temperature, but affecting equally nearly all fungi and therefore causing no significant differences in diversity and community composition. Despite the minimal effects caused by the drying procedures at the fungal community composition, freeze-drying resulted in higher concentrations of L. vinosus DNA and prevented potential colonization from opportunistic species.",

Phyllosphere microbiota play a critical role in protecting plants from diseases as well as promoting their growth by various mechanisms. There are serious gaps in our understanding of how and why microbiota composition varies across spatial and temporal scales, the ecology of leaf surface colonizers and their interactions with their host, and the genetic adaptations that enable phyllosphere survival of microorganisms. These gaps are due in large part to past technical limitations, as earlier studies were restricted to the study of culturable bacteria only and used low-throughput molecular techniques to describe community structure and function. The availability of high-throughput and cost-effective molecular technologies is changing the field of phyllosphere microbiology, enabling researchers to begin to address the dynamics and composition of the phyllosphere microbiota across a large number of samples with high, in-depth coverage. Here, we discuss and connect the most recent studies that have used next-generation molecular techniques such as metagenomics, proteogenomics, genome sequencing, and transcriptomics to gain new insights into the structure and function of phyllosphere microbiota and highlight important challenges for future research.",

In this study, we have explored the usefulness of profiling small subunit ribosomal (SSR) gene fragments for studying the microflora associated with seeds. DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the amplicons separated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Primers targeting eukaryotic SSRs were used to investigate fungal communities, and primers targeting bacterial SSRs were employed to study the eubacterial microflora. As a case study, we attempted to profile the fungi and bacteria associated with seeds of Beta vulgaris (sugar beet) to permit an insight into the varying field performance of several well-characterised commercial seed lots. Serious interference with the microbial signals was observed from the plant's own nuclear 18S rRNA genes and chloroplast 16S rRNA genes using standard PCR conditions and DNA extracted from whole seeds as template. Hot-start and touchdown PCR made no appreciable improvement to these signals. Seed imbibition and dissection into operculum and fruit wall and true seed prior to DNA extraction improved signal recovery in the fruit fraction. With primer modification, bacteria and fungi were detected in an excess of plant DNA of 100:1 and 10:1, respectively. With this method, microbial communities on seeds could be profiled, however, it is likely that targeted depletion of plant rDNA targets will be a necessary extra step before this approach can be used to screen seeds routinely.",

We wanted to gain insight in the impact of primer choice on the outcome of short read sequencing efforts. All the unknowns associated with sequencing data, i.e. primer coverage rate, phylogeny, OTU-richness and taxonomic assignment, were therefore implemented in one study for ten well established universal primers (338f/r, 518f/r, 799f/r, 926f/r and 1062f/r) targeting dispersed regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. All analyses were performed on nearly full length and in silico generated short read sequence libraries containing 1175 sequences that were carefully chosen as to present a representative substitute of the SILVA SSU database. The 518f and 799r primers, targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, were found to be particularly suited for short read sequencing studies, while the primer 1062r, targeting V6, seemed to be least reliable. Our results will assist scientists in considering whether the best option for their study is to select the most informative primer, or the primer that excludes interferences by host-organelle DNA.

Methods and Results: Three different soil DNA isolation and four purification strategies were compared on different soil samples with variable rates of success. Bead beating extraction gave significantly higher DNA yields than microwave-based and liquid nitrogen grinding DNA extraction methods. The inclusion of soil washing prior to cell lysis decreased the amount of purification steps required. Although these soil types differed, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP)-sepharose 2B column elution was sufficient for all three samples, yielding DNA pure enough for successful application in molecular studies. One soil sample retained 80% of the initial DNA after successful purification. Conclusions: Optimization of a purification protocol confirmed that only a combination of previously described methods proved sufficient in yielding pure environmental DNA from humic-rich soils. Total processing time for DNA extraction and subsequent purification from multiple samples was considerably more rapid than the previously described methods.

		"abstract": "Environmental DNA metabarcoding is becoming a key tool for biodiversity monitoring over large geographical or taxonomic scales and for elusive taxa like soil organisms. Increasing sample sizes and interest in remote or extreme areas often require the preservation of soil samples and thus deviations from optimal standardized protocols. However, we still ignore the impact of different methods of soil sample preservation on the results of metabarcoding studies and there is no guideline for best practices so far. Here, we assessed the impact of four methods of soil sample preservation that can be conveniently used also in metabarcoding studies targeting remote or difficult to access areas. Tested methods include: preservation at room temperature for 6h, preservation at 4°C for three days, desiccation immediately after sampling and preservation for 21 days, and desiccation after 6h at room temperature and preservation for 21 days. For each preservation method, we benchmarked resulting estimates of taxon diversity and community composition of three different taxonomic groups (bacteria, fungi and eukaryotes) in three different habitats (forest, river bank and grassland) against results obtained under ideal conditions (i.e. extraction of eDNA right after sampling). Overall, the different preservation methods only marginally impaired results and only under certain conditions. When rare taxa were considered, we detected small but significant changes in MOTU richness of bacteria, fungi and eukaryotes across treatments, but MOTUs richness was similar across preservation methods if rare taxa were not considered. All the approaches were able to identify differences in community structure among habitats, and the communities retrieved using the different preservation conditions were extremely similar. We propose guidelines on the selection of the optimal soil sample preservation conditions for metabarcoding studies, depending on the practical constraints, costs and ultimate research goals.",

Subsequently, we tested whether we could correctly infer habitat type and original sample identity after storage using a large reference dataset. We found stronger community composition differences with extended storage time and with higher storage temperature, and differences between open and closed tubes.

		"abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) is rapidly growing in popularity as a tool for community assessments and species detection. While eDNA approaches are now widely applied, there is not yet agreement on best practices for sample collection and processing. Investigators looking to integrate eDNA approaches into their research programme are required to examine a growing collection of disparate studies to make an often uncertain decision about which protocols best fit their needs. To promote the application of eDNA approaches and to encourage the generation of high-quality data, here we review the most common techniques for the collection, preservation and extraction of metazoan eDNA from water samples. Specifically, we focus on experimental studies that compare various methods and outline the numerous challenges associated with eDNA. While the diverse applications of eDNA do not lend themselves to a one-size-fits-all recommendation, in most cases, capture/concentration of eDNA on cellulose nitrate filters (with pore size determined by water turbidity), followed by storage of filters in Longmire's buffer and extraction with a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (or similar) has been shown to provide sufficient, high-quality DNA. However, we also emphasize the importance of testing and optimizing protocols for the system of interest.",

		"abstract": "Storage of soil samples prior to metagenomic analysis presents a problem. If field sites are remote or if samples are collected by third parties, transport to analytical laboratories may take several days or even weeks. The bulk of such samples and requirement for later homogenisation precludes the convenient use of a stabilisation buffer, so samples are usually cooled or frozen during transit. There has been limited testing of the most appropriate storage methods for later study of soil organisms by eDNA approaches. Here we tested a range of storage methods on two contrasting soils, comparing these methods to the control of freezing at -80 °C, followed by freeze-drying. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of storage conditions on eukaryote DNA in soil, including both viable organisms (fungi) and DNA contained within dying/dead tissues (plants). For fungi, the best storage regimes (closest to the control) were storage at 4 °C (for up to 14 d) or active air-drying at room temperature. The worst treatments involved initial freezing, followed by thawing which led to significant later spoilage. The key spoilage organisms were identified as Metarhizium carneum and Mortierella spp., with a general increase in saprotrophic fungi and reduced abundances of mycorrhizal/biotrophic fungi. Plant data showed a similar pattern, but with greater variability in community structure, especially in the freeze-thaw treatments, probably due to stochastic variation in substrates for fungal decomposition, algal proliferation and some seed germination. In the absence of freeze drying facilities, samples should be shipped refrigerated, but not frozen if there is any risk of thawing.",

		"abstract": "Abstract   A wide range of methods are commonly used for preserving environmental samples prior to molecular analyses. However, the effect of these preservation methods on fungal DNA is not understood. The objective of this study was to test the effect of eight different preservation methods on the quality and yield of DNA extracted from Bromus inermis and Daucus carota roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Glomus intraradices. The total DNA concentration in sample extracts was quantified using spectrophotometry. Samples that were frozen (−80oC and −20oC), stored in 95% ethanol, or silica gel dried yielded total (plant and fungal) DNA concentrations that were not significantly different from fresh samples. In contrast, samples stored in CTAB solution or freeze-dried resulted in significantly reduced DNA concentrations compared with fresh samples. The preservation methods had no effect on the purity of the sample extracts for both plant species. However, the DNA of the dried samples (silica gel dried, freeze-dried, heat dried) appeared to be slightly more degraded compared with samples that remained hydrated (frozen, stored in ethanol or CTAB solutions) during storage when visualized on a gel. The concentration of AM fungal DNA in sample extracts was quantified using TaqMan real time PCR. Methods that preserved samples in hydrated form had similar AM fungal DNA concentrations as fresh samples, except D. carota samples stored in ethanol. In contrast, preservation methods that involved drying the samples had very low concentrations of AM fungal DNA for B. inermis, and nearly undetectable for D. carota samples. The drying process appears to be a major factor in the degradation of AM fungal DNA while having less of an impact on plant DNA. Based on these results, samples that need to be preserved prior to molecular analysis of AM fungi should be kept frozen to minimize the degradation of plant and AM fungal DNA.",
